# Aevatar Platform — Product Summary (Verified)

*Empower developers to build, run, and evolve intelligent, event-sourced AI agents at scale.*

---

## 1. Executive Overview
Aevatar combines **Aevatar Framework** (distributed actor core) and **Aevatar Station** (developer & ops tooling) to give teams a turnkey way to create AI-driven micro-services called *GAgents*.  Under the hood, the platform leverages Microsoft Orleans' virtual-actor model, event sourcing, and a pluggable stream layer (Kafka or in-memory).  Real-time client interaction is delivered through an out-of-the-box SignalR hub.

> **Verification status:** All architectural claims below are confirmed by repository source code unless otherwise noted *(see `docs/factual_verification.md`).*

## 2. What Makes Aevatar Stand Out

### 2.1 Scalable Virtual Actors *(Confirmed)*
* `GAgentBase` inherits from `JournaledGrain<TState,…>` 14:25:framework/src/Aevatar.Core/GAgentBase.cs  
* Dynamic placement & rebalance provided by Orleans → add silos, increase throughput.

### 2.2 Event-Sourced State & Audit *(Confirmed)*
* `[LogConsistencyProvider("LogStorage")]` attribute + MongoDB implementation keep an immutable event log.
* Time-travel debugging and compliant audit trails come for free.

### 2.3 Realtime API via SignalR *(Confirmed)*
* `AevatarSignalRHub : Hub` exposes methods like `PublishEventAsync` for millisecond latency messaging.

### 2.4 Polyglot Stream Provider *(Confirmed)*
* `OrleansHostExtension` wires `siloBuilder.AddKafka("Aevatar")` when configured; otherwise falls back to in-memory streams.

### 2.5 Hierarchical Agent Composition *(Confirmed)*
* Parent/child registration in `RegisterAsync`, `RegisterManyAsync` enables complex workflows to be modeled as trees of agents.

### 2.6 Operational Dashboard *(Confirmed)*
* Built-in Orleans Dashboard exposed via configurable port for live cluster metrics.

### 2.7 Environmental Flexibility *(Partially Confirmed)*
* Environment variables reference Kubernetes (`POD_IP`, `ORLEANS_CLUSTER_ID`) indicating deployment awareness.  
* **Note**: Docker/K8s manifests are *not* included in the repo; operators can supply their own.

### 2.8 Horizontal Cost Efficiency *(Plausible)*
* Orleans activations are lightweight and billed per node; cost scales with compute resources.  
* No hard data or benchmarks are present—teams should measure for their workload.

## 3. Technical Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Actor Runtime | Microsoft Orleans 8 (Virtual Actors) |
| Event Store | MongoDB (pluggable) |
| Stream Provider | Kafka or In-Memory |
| Cache / Cluster DB | Redis |
| Realtime Gateway | ASP.NET Core + SignalR |
| Auth & API | ASP.NET Core, OpenIddict, ABP Framework |

---

## 4. Typical Use-Cases
* Conversational AI agents that need persistent memory
* IoT fleets or robotics swarms requiring command & telemetry channels
* Digital-twin simulations with thousands of entities
* Workflow orchestration where every state change must be auditable

---

## 5. Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the monorepo
git clone https://github.com/aevatarAI/aevatar-station.git
cd aevatar-station/station/src

# Run database migrations
cd Aevatar.DbMigrator && dotnet run && cd ..

# Start the Orleans silo
cd Aevatar.Silo && dotnet run

# Start the HTTP API
cd ../Aevatar.HttpApi.Host && dotnet run
```
Once running, connect a WebSocket client to `/api/agent/aevatarHub` to publish events in real time.

---

## 6. Roadmap & Opportunities
* **Containerization assets** – Provide Helm charts & Docker Compose for one-line cloud deployment.  *(community help welcome!)*
* **Benchmark suite** – Publish performance data for common agent workloads.

## 7. Aevatar vs. LangGraph
| Feature | Aevatar Platform | LangGraph (LangChain ecosystem) |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Primary Language / Runtime | C# / .NET 8, Microsoft Orleans virtual-actors | Python, built on top of LangChain primitives |
| Concurrency Model | Distributed virtual actors (grains) auto-balanced across silos → horizontal scale-out | In-process async DAG; parallelism limited by Python event loop unless user adds external infra |
| State Persistence | Event-sourced with immutable log (MongoDB, pluggable DBs) **built-in** | Ephemeral by default; developers wire custom storage for memory/state |
| Real-Time Client Connectivity | SignalR hub (`/api/agent/aevatarHub`) supports bi-directional WebSocket messaging | No built-in realtime gateway—requires separate API layer |
| Deployment Footprint | Runs on Docker / VMs / Kubernetes; single binary per service, dashboard included | Python package; scaling & ops left to user (e.g. Ray, Dask, serverless) |
| Built-in Infrastructure Adapters | Kafka streams, Redis cache, MongoDB event store, Orleans Dashboard | Integrates LangChain toolset (vector DBs, LLM providers) but no message bus/DB opinions |
| Hierarchical Composition | Parent/child GAgents with dynamic registration (tree or mesh topologies) | Graph nodes & edges (DAG/cyclic) but no concept of distributed ownership |
| Audit & Compliance | Full event log replay; state versioning | Depends on user-supplied callbacks/storage |
| Auth & Multi-Tenant API | ABP + OpenIddict server included | Not included |
| Ideal Use-Cases | Production-grade, multi-tenant AI backends needing strong consistency, realtime UX | Rapid prototyping of LLM workflows, research notebooks |

**Key Takeaway:** LangGraph excels at quick Python-based experimentation, while **Aevatar** provides a production-ready, cloud-native runtime with persistent state, horizontal scalability, and realtime APIs baked in. Teams that need enterprise-grade reliability, audit trails, and .NET ecosystem integration will benefit from Aevatar's opinionated infrastructure stack.

Build once, scale effortlessly, evolve rapidly — **Aevatar** puts production-ready AI agents within reach of every .NET developer.
