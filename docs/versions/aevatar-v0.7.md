## Technical Enhancements

### Domain Management Infrastructure
- Automatic domain generation algorithms with conflict resolution
- Integration with DNS infrastructure and domain registrar APIs
- Domain lifecycle management with automated cleanup
- Audit trail for all domain generation and management activities

### Design System Implementation
- Comprehensive design system with consistent visual language
- Modern, clean aesthetic reflecting cutting-edge AI technology
- Cross-browser compatibility and responsive design
- Component library for maintainable and scalable development

### Documentation Integration
- Structured documentation registry mapping field types to relevant URLs
- Automated link validation system for detecting broken or outdated documentation
- Dynamic documentation updates without application deployment
- Integration with existing tooltip/help system from Agent Configuration Management

## Performance Requirements

### Domain Generation
- Domain generation must complete within 3 seconds during project creation
- Globally unique domain names across the entire platform
- Compliance with RFC 1123 DNS naming standards
- Support for both single-tenant and multi-tenant deployment scenarios

### UI Performance
- All design changes must maintain existing functionality and user workflows
- No impact on application performance or loading times
- Responsive design functionality across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Compatibility with existing accessibility features and assistive technologies

### Documentation Links
- Documentation links must not impact form performance or loading times
- External documentation availability should not block user workflow progression
- Fast documentation access through content delivery optimization

## Acceptance Criteria Summary
- ✅ Automatic domain generation for new projects without user input
- ✅ Generated domains immediately usable and properly configured in DNS
- ✅ Domain cleanup occurs automatically when projects are deleted
- ✅ Complete visual refresh with consistent design language across the platform
- ✅ Dark mode and light mode support with user preference persistence
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance for all updated components
- ✅ Direct links to official documentation for obtaining required field values
- ✅ Documentation link validation system identifies and reports broken links
- ✅ Integration with existing tooltip/help system provides consistent user experience

## Dependencies
- v0.6 User Onboarding and Workflow Error Visibility features
- DNS infrastructure and domain registrar APIs
- Design system infrastructure and component library
- Documentation registry and link validation services
- Existing Agent Configuration Management tooltip/help system

## Breaking Changes
- None - fully backward compatible with v0.6

## Performance Improvements
- Streamlined project creation process without manual domain input
- Optimized visual rendering with modern design system
- Enhanced user experience through contextual documentation links
- Automated domain and link management reducing support burden

## Known Limitations
- Domain generation requires internet connectivity for DNS validation
- Custom domain configuration not included (planned for future versions)
- Advanced theming customization beyond dark/light modes not included
- Documentation link system requires periodic maintenance for accuracy
- Multi-language documentation support may be limited based on vendor availability
- Domain cleanup may have delays in DNS propagation across global infrastructure
