# 1. Canvas-Based Workflow Assembly

## User Story
As a user, I want to assemble workflows by dragging and dropping agent nodes onto a canvas, so that I can visually construct and modify agent workflows.

**Estimated Time: 24 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can add agent nodes to the canvas via drag-and-drop from the palette.
2. Users can move, modify, and remove agent nodes on the canvas.
3. Canvas supports zooming, panning, and undo/redo actions.
4. All agent node positions and changes are reflected in the workflow data model.

# 2. Node Palette with Search and Filter

## User Story
As a user, I want a searchable and filterable palette of agent nodes, so that I can easily find and add the right agents to my workflow.

**Estimated Time: 12 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Palette displays all available agent nodes with consistent visual styling.
2. Users can search and filter agent nodes by functionality or name.
3. Only valid agent nodes can be added to the canvas.
4. Agent nodes are clearly categorized by their primary function or type.

# 3. Agent Connection Logic and Execution Flow

## User Story
As a user, I want to connect agent nodes to define execution logic, including sequential, parallel, and conditional flows, so that I can model complex agent workflows.

**Estimated Time: 20 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can create connections between agent nodes to define execution order.
2. Supports sequential, parallel, and conditional connections between agents.
3. Users can modify or remove connections between agents.
4. The system prevents creation of invalid connections (e.g., cycles, dead ends).

# 4. Workflow Validation and Error Highlighting

## User Story
As a user, I want the system to instantly validate my workflow and visually highlight invalid configurations, so that I can quickly identify and fix errors.

**Estimated Time: 14 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The system detects and highlights unconnected or misconfigured agent nodes.
2. Invalid connections between agents are visually indicated and blocked.
3. Error messages or tooltips explain the nature of each issue.
4. Validation occurs in real time as the workflow is edited.

# 5. Real-Time Data Model Synchronization

## User Story
As a user, I want all modifications in the visual designer to be accurately and instantly reflected in the underlying workflow data model, so that my changes are always saved and consistent.

**Estimated Time: 12 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All node and connection changes update the workflow data model in real time.
2. The data model remains consistent with the visual state of the canvas.
3. No changes are lost during editing sessions.

# 6. Desktop Browser Responsiveness and Accessibility

## User Story
As a user, I want the workflow designer interface to be responsive and accessible on desktop browsers, so that I can efficiently use it regardless of my device or accessibility needs.

**Estimated Time: 10 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The interface adapts to different desktop screen sizes and resolutions.
2. All controls and features are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
3. Visual indicators and controls are clear and usable for all users.

# 7. Workflow Execution Trigger (Play Button)

## User Story
As a user, I want a prominent 'Play' button in the workflow designer so that I can trigger the execution of the currently loaded workflow directly from the UI.

**Estimated Time: 10 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A 'Play' button is visible in the workflow designer UI.
2. The button is only enabled when the workflow passes validation (no critical errors).
3. Clicking the button triggers execution of the current workflow.
4. UI provides clear feedback when execution starts (e.g., loading indicator, status message).
5. The 'Play' button is disabled if the workflow is invalid or incomplete.
6. Triggered executions are reflected in the execution dashboard in real time.
