# AEVatar SignalR Project Tracker

This document tracks the development status of features and tasks for the AEVatar SignalR project. It is used by the automated development workflow to manage task assignments, branch creation, and development progress.

## Status Legend
- ðŸ”œ - Planned (upcoming task)
- ðŸš§ - In Progress (currently being developed)
- âœ… - Completed (development finished)

## Development Notes

- When starting work on a task, update its status to ðŸš§ and add your machine's MAC address
- Branch names should follow the pattern `feature/feature-name`
- Test coverage should be updated after implementing unit tests, regression tests, and calculating overall coverage
- Priority levels: High, Medium, Low
- Add detailed notes about implementation decisions and challenges
