Epic: 6. Documentation Links for Required Fields
---

# 1. Documentation Link Display for API Keys

## User Story
As a user configuring agent nodes that require API keys, I want to see direct links to official documentation for obtaining those keys so that I can quickly get the credentials I need without searching external sites.

**Version:** v0.7

**Estimated Time:** 14 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I am configuring an agent node that requires an API key  
**When** I view the API key input field  
**Then** I see a clearly labeled link to the official documentation for obtaining that specific API key  

**Given** I click on a documentation link for API keys  
**When** the link opens  
**Then** it directs me to the exact page for creating and managing the required API key type  

**Given** I need API keys for popular services  
**When** I configure nodes for Telegram, OpenAI, Discord, Slack, or similar services  
**Then** each has a direct link to the appropriate official API key documentation  

# 2. Documentation Link Management and Validation

## User Story
As a platform administrator, I want documentation links to be automatically validated and managed so that users always receive current and working links to external resources.

**Version:** v0.7

**Estimated Time:** 18 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** documentation links are configured in the system  
**When** the validation system runs  
**Then** broken or outdated links are automatically detected and flagged  

**Given** a documentation link becomes unavailable  
**When** users try to access it  
**Then** they see a clear message with fallback options or alternative resources  

**Given** I need to update documentation links  
**When** I access the link management interface  
**Then** I can easily update URLs and verify they work correctly
