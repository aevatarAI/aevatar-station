## Task Details

### ExceptionCatchAndPublish
- Implement mechanism to catch exceptions from GAgent EventHandlers
- Create data structure for exception information including context and timestamp
- Publish exceptions to a dedicated Orleans Stream (separate KafkaTopic)
- Ensure isolation between business topics and exception topic
- Add configuration for exception stream name/topic

**Testing & Documentation:**
- **Unit tests**: Create unit tests for exception catching, formatting, and publishing
- **Regression tests**: Ensure existing functionality isn't affected by the exception handling
- **Integration tests**: Verify exceptions are properly published and received by subscribers
- **Documentation**: Document the exception handling mechanism, configuration options, and subscriber implementation

### Kafka Stream optimization
- Improve throughput and latency of Kafka streams
- Reduce resource consumption
- Implement batching strategies
- Tune configuration parameters
- Benchmark performance before and after optimization

**Testing & Documentation:**
- **Unit tests**: Create unit tests for individual components, batching mechanisms, configuration parameter validation, and edge cases
- **Regression tests**: Develop test suite to ensure optimizations don't break existing functionality, create baseline metrics, automate regression testing
- **Integration tests**: Verify interaction between optimized Kafka streams and other system components, test end-to-end data flow, verify behavior under various loads
- **Documentation**: Document optimization strategies, create configuration guides, document benchmarks and results, create troubleshooting guide

### End to end gagent streaming
- Implement continuous streaming between all gagent components
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery
- Add monitoring and observability
- Test with high-volume scenarios
- Document the streaming architecture and patterns

**Testing & Documentation:**
- **Unit tests**: Develop tests for each streaming component, test initialization/shutdown sequences, error handling, and data transformation correctness
- **Regression tests**: Create test suite to maintain functionality, develop performance baseline metrics, automate regression testing
- **Integration tests**: Test complete end-to-end streaming with all components, verify behavior with external systems, test failure recovery and data consistency
- **Documentation**: Document architecture, create setup and configuration guides, document monitoring features, create tuning guidelines

### Optimize GAgent Publish logic
- Improve performance and speed of GAgent Publish operations
- Refactor publish logic for efficiency
- Implement parallel processing where applicable
- Reduce latency in publishing pipeline
- Optimize memory usage during publish operations
- Benchmark performance before and after optimization

**Testing & Documentation:**
- **Unit tests**: Create unit tests for optimized publish components, test performance under different loads, verify correctness of parallel operations
- **Regression tests**: Develop test suite to ensure optimizations don't break existing functionality, create baseline metrics, automate regression testing
- **Integration tests**: Verify interaction between optimized publish logic and other system components, test end-to-end publishing flow, measure performance improvements
- **Documentation**: Document optimization strategies, create configuration guides, document benchmarks and results, update architecture diagrams

### ProjectionGrain Placement Update
- Update placement logic for StateProjectionGrain and related grains
- Ensure proper placement of grains in the system
- Implement new placement strategies
- Benchmark performance before and after update

**Testing & Documentation:**
- **Unit tests**: Create unit tests for placement logic, test different placement scenarios, verify behavior under various loads
- **Regression tests**: Develop test suite to ensure updates don't break existing functionality, create baseline metrics, automate regression testing
- **Integration tests**: Verify interaction between placement logic and other system components, test end-to-end placement flow, measure performance improvements
- **Documentation**: Document placement strategies, create configuration guides, document benchmarks and results, create troubleshooting guide

## Future Tasks
- *To be determined*

## Completed Tasks
- **PermissionEventBase** (2024-01-XX): Implemented abstract base class for permission-related events with UserContext propagation. Includes comprehensive documentation and follows Orleans serialization patterns.

## Notes
- Update this tracker regularly as tasks progress
- Add new tasks as they are identified
- Move completed tasks to the Completed section with completion date
