# Shared Memory System for User Context

## Overview
Implements a unified memory layer that enables all agents to share context, preferences, and learned information for individual users, creating a persistent and intelligent memory system that enhances agent capabilities and user experience continuity.

### User Story

As a user interacting with multiple AI agents across different sessions and requests, I want all agents to remember our previous conversations, my preferences, and learned information about me, so that each interaction builds upon previous knowledge and provides increasingly personalized and contextually relevant responses.

### Key Features

- **Persistent User Memory:**
  - Each user has a dedicated, encrypted memory space that persists across all sessions
  - Memory survives system restarts, deployments, and extended periods of inactivity
  - Automatic backup and recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss

- **Multi-Category Memory Management:**
  - **Conversational Memory:** Complete chat histories with context preservation
  - **Preference Memory:** User settings, communication style preferences, and behavioral patterns
  - **Knowledge Memory:** Facts about the user, their domain expertise, and interests
  - **Task Memory:** Ongoing projects, goals, and progress tracking across sessions

- **Real-Time Agent Memory Access:**
  - All agents can instantly access and update shared memory during interactions
  - Concurrent access protection with optimistic locking and conflict resolution
  - Memory updates are immediately available to other agents in the same user context

- **Intelligent Memory Operations:**
  - Semantic search across all memory content using embeddings
  - Automatic categorization and tagging of new memory entries
  - Context-aware memory retrieval based on current conversation topics
  - Smart memory summarization to prevent information overload

- **Privacy and Security Controls:**
  - End-to-end encryption for all memory data at rest and in transit
  - User-controlled memory categories with granular sharing permissions
  - Complete audit trail of all memory access and modifications
  - GDPR-compliant data handling with user rights for access, correction, and deletion

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Sub-100ms memory read operations for real-time conversations
  - Intelligent caching with automatic cache invalidation
  - Memory compression for efficient storage utilization
  - Pagination for large memory datasets to maintain responsiveness

### Technical Implementation Details

- **Storage Architecture:**
  - Primary storage using MongoDB for structured data and metadata
  - Vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) for semantic search capabilities
  - Redis cache layer for frequently accessed memories
  - Blob storage (Azure/AWS) for large files and attachments

- **API Design:**
  - RESTful API with GraphQL support for complex queries
  - WebSocket connections for real-time memory synchronization
  - SDK integration with existing agent framework
  - Rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse

- **Data Model:**
  ```
  UserMemory {
    userId: string,
    category: MemoryCategory,
    content: object,
    metadata: {
      createdAt: timestamp,
      updatedAt: timestamp,
      agentId: string,
      importance: number,
      tags: string[],
      expiresAt?: timestamp
    },
    embedding?: vector,
    accessLevel: PrivacyLevel
  }
  ```

### Acceptance Criteria

### Memory Persistence

**Given** I have a conversation with an agent  
**When** we interact and exchange information  
**Then** all context and information is automatically stored in my personal memory  

**Given** I return to the system after days or weeks  
**When** I interact with agents  
**Then** agents remember our previous conversations and can reference past interactions  

**Given** the system undergoes maintenance or updates  
**When** system maintenance occurs  
**Then** memory survives system maintenance, updates, and restarts without data loss  

### Cross-Agent Context Sharing

**Given** I switch from one agent to another  
**When** I start interacting with the new agent  
**Then** the new agent has access to relevant context from previous agents  

**Given** multiple agents have learned information about me  
**When** I interact with any agent  
**Then** agents can reference information learned by other agents in previous sessions  

**Given** I move between different agents  
**When** context needs to be transferred  
**Then** context handoffs between agents are seamless and don't require me to repeat information  

### Intelligent Memory Retrieval

**Given** I am having a conversation about a specific topic  
**When** agents need relevant background information  
**Then** agents can find relevant information from my memory based on the current conversation topic  

**Given** agents search through my memory  
**When** they retrieve information  
**Then** memory search results are ranked by relevance and recency  

**Given** agents access my historical context  
**When** they present information to me  
**Then** agents can summarize relevant past context without overwhelming me with details  

### User Control and Privacy

**Given** I want to see what information is stored about me  
**When** I access my memory interface  
**Then** I can view all information stored in my memory through a user-friendly interface  

**Given** I want to modify my stored information  
**When** I access memory management  
**Then** I can edit, delete, or modify any memory entries  

**Given** I want to control agent access to my information  
**When** I configure privacy settings  
**Then** I can control which categories of memory different agents can access  

**Given** information is being stored about me  
**When** the storage occurs  
**Then** I receive clear notifications about what information is being stored  

### Performance Requirements

**Given** agents need to access my memory during conversations  
**When** memory operations occur  
**Then** memory operations don't cause noticeable delays in agent responses (< 100ms)  

**Given** I am using multiple agents simultaneously  
**When** concurrent access to my memory occurs  
**Then** the system handles concurrent access when I'm using multiple agents simultaneously  

**Given** I have large amounts of stored data  
**When** agents search or retrieve memory  
**Then** memory search and retrieval remain fast even with large amounts of stored data  

### Security and Compliance

**Given** my memory data is stored in the system  
**When** data is at rest or in transit  
**Then** all my memory data is encrypted and secure from unauthorized access  

**Given** I want to export my data  
**When** I request data export  
**Then** I can export all my memory data in a standard format  

**Given** I want to exercise my right to be forgotten  
**When** I request data deletion  
**Then** I can request complete deletion of my memory data (right to be forgotten)  

**Given** my memory is accessed by agents or system processes  
**When** access occurs  
**Then** the system maintains audit logs of who accessed my memory and when  

### Integration and Reliability

**Given** existing agents are updated to use the memory system  
**When** agents interact with the memory system  
**Then** existing agents work with the memory system without breaking changes  

**Given** the memory system is part of the overall infrastructure  
**When** I use the system  
**Then** the memory system has 99.9% uptime and high availability  

**Given** memory operations occasionally fail  
**When** failures occur  
**Then** failed memory operations are handled gracefully without disrupting conversations  

**Given** agents are distributed across different systems  
**When** memory needs to be synchronized  
**Then** memory synchronization across distributed agents is consistent and reliable  

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

**Given** multiple agents try to update the same memory simultaneously  
**When** concurrent updates occur  
**Then** the system uses conflict resolution to merge or prioritize updates  

**Given** I am approaching memory storage limits  
**When** my memory usage is high  
**Then** I receive notifications when approaching memory limits and can archive or delete old memories  

**Given** my memory data becomes corrupted  
**When** corruption is detected  
**Then** automatic detection and recovery of corrupted memory with fallback to previous versions occurs  

**Given** the system detects sensitive information in conversations  
**When** sensitive data is encountered  
**Then** the system automatically detects and prevents storage of sensitive information (passwords, payment details)  

**Given** the memory system is temporarily unavailable  
**When** agents need to continue operating  
**Then** agents degrade gracefully when memory system is unavailable, using local session context as fallback
