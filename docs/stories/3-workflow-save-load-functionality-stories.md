Epic: 3. Workflow Save/Load Functionality via UI
---

# 1. Workflow Save and Load

## Overview
Enables users to persist and retrieve workflow configurations, including versioning, JSON import/export, UI feedback, and template support.

### User Story
As a workflow designer user, I want to save my current workflow (with versioning) and load existing workflows (including from JSON files and templates) so that I can efficiently manage, reuse, and recover my workflow configurations without data loss.

**Time Estimate: 28 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can save the current workflow to the backend, and each save creates a new version.
2. Users can load existing workflows from the backend, including selecting specific versions.
3. Users can import workflows into the designer from a JSON file, and the imported workflow is accurately reflected in the UI.
4. Users receive clear UI feedback (success or failure) when saving or loading workflows.
5. Users can access and use workflow templates when creating or loading workflows.
6. No data loss occurs during save or load operations, and workflows are restored exactly as saved.
