## Current Tasks

| Feature | Status | Description | Unit Tests | Regression Tests | Integration Tests | Documentation |
|---------|--------|-------------|------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Kafka Stream optimization | Not Started | Optimize Kafka streams for better performance and lower resource usage | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| End to end gagent streaming | Not Started | Implement complete end-to-end streaming for gagent | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

## Task Details

### Kafka Stream optimization
- Improve throughput and latency of Kafka streams
- Reduce resource consumption
- Implement batching strategies
- Tune configuration parameters
- Benchmark performance before and after optimization

**Testing & Documentation:**
- **Unit tests**: Create unit tests for individual components, batching mechanisms, configuration parameter validation, and edge cases
- **Regression tests**: Develop test suite to ensure optimizations don't break existing functionality, create baseline metrics, automate regression testing
- **Integration tests**: Verify interaction between optimized Kafka streams and other system components, test end-to-end data flow, verify behavior under various loads
- **Documentation**: Document optimization strategies, create configuration guides, document benchmarks and results, create troubleshooting guide

### End to end gagent streaming
- Implement continuous streaming between all gagent components
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery
- Add monitoring and observability
- Test with high-volume scenarios
- Document the streaming architecture and patterns

**Testing & Documentation:**
- **Unit tests**: Develop tests for each streaming component, test initialization/shutdown sequences, error handling, and data transformation correctness
- **Regression tests**: Create test suite to maintain functionality, develop performance baseline metrics, automate regression testing
- **Integration tests**: Test complete end-to-end streaming with all components, verify behavior with external systems, test failure recovery and data consistency
- **Documentation**: Document architecture, create setup and configuration guides, document monitoring features, create tuning guidelines
