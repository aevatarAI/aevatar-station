# 1. Default Input Values for New Agent Nodes

## User Story
As a user creating a new agent node, I want the system to automatically populate all required fields with appropriate default values, so that I can immediately save and use the agent without having to manually configure every field.

**Estimated Time: 16 hours**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When I create a new agent node, all required fields are pre-populated with contextually appropriate default values
2. Default values are specific to the agent type and based on common use cases
3. I can immediately save the agent node without validation errors
4. Default values are visually distinguishable from user-entered values (e.g., placeholder styling)
5. I can reset any field back to its default value using a reset option
6. Default values pass all validation rules and don't cause runtime errors

# 2. Auto-Save Configuration Changes

## User Story
As a user configuring agent nodes, I want all my configuration changes to be automatically saved without clicking a save button, so that I never lose my work and can focus on building workflows.

**Estimated Time: 20 hours**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When I change any configuration value, it is automatically saved within 2 seconds
2. I receive visual feedback showing save status (saving, saved, error)
3. If a save fails, I am notified with a clear error message and automatic retry occurs
4. All form inputs (text, dropdowns, checkboxes) trigger auto-save behavior
5. Auto-save operations are debounced to prevent excessive server requests
6. Changes are preserved if I navigate away and return to the configuration
7. A global save indicator shows the overall workflow save state

# 3. Real-Time Configuration Validation

## User Story
As a user configuring agent nodes, I want immediate validation feedback as I enter values, so that I can quickly identify and fix configuration errors before they cause runtime issues.

**Estimated Time: 14 hours**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When I enter invalid values, I receive immediate visual feedback with error styling
2. Validation occurs in real-time as I type or change values
3. Error messages provide specific guidance on how to fix the issue
4. Valid configurations are indicated with positive visual feedback (green checkmarks)
5. Required fields are clearly marked and validated
6. The system prevents saving of configurations with critical validation errors
7. Validation rules are appropriate for each agent type and field
8. Warning indicators appear for configurations that may cause runtime issues

# 4. Configuration Change History

## User Story
As a user making configuration changes, I want the ability to undo and redo my recent changes, so that I can easily recover from mistakes and experiment with different configurations.

**Estimated Time: 12 hours**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. I can undo the last 10 configuration changes using Ctrl+Z or an undo button
2. I can redo undone changes using Ctrl+Y or a redo button
3. The system maintains a visual history of recent configuration changes
4. Undo/redo operations are scoped to individual agent nodes
5. The undo/redo state is preserved during auto-save operations
6. Clear visual indicators show when undo/redo operations are available
7. Configuration history is cleared when I navigate away from the workflow
