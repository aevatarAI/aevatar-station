Epic: 1. Visual Workflow Designer (Drag-and-Drop Interface)
---

# 1. Canvas-Based Workflow Assembly

## User Story
As a user, I want to assemble workflows by dragging and dropping nodes onto a canvas, so that I can visually construct and modify agent workflows.

**Estimated Time: 24 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can add nodes to the canvas via drag-and-drop from the palette.
2. Users can move, modify, and remove nodes on the canvas.
3. Canvas supports zooming, panning, and undo/redo actions.
4. All node positions and changes are reflected in the workflow data model.

# 2. Node Palette with Search, Filter, and Visual Distinction

## User Story
As a user, I want a searchable and filterable palette of node types, with each group visually distinct, so that I can easily find and add the right nodes to my workflow.

**Estimated Time: 16 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Palette displays all available node types, grouped by category (Agent, Event, Output).
2. Each node group has a unique visual style in the palette.
3. Users can search and filter node types by category or name.
4. Only valid node types can be added to the canvas.

# 3. Node Connection Logic and Execution Flow

## User Story
As a user, I want to connect nodes to define execution logic, including sequential, parallel, and conditional flows, so that I can model complex agent workflows.

**Estimated Time: 20 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can create connections between nodes to define execution order.
2. Supports sequential, parallel, and conditional connections.
3. Users can modify or remove connections.
4. The system prevents creation of invalid connections (e.g., cycles, dead ends).

# 4. Workflow Validation and Error Highlighting

## User Story
As a user, I want the system to instantly validate my workflow and visually highlight invalid configurations, so that I can quickly identify and fix errors.

**Estimated Time: 14 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The system detects and highlights unconnected or misconfigured nodes.
2. Invalid connections are visually indicated and blocked.
3. Error messages or tooltips explain the nature of each issue.
4. Validation occurs in real time as the workflow is edited.

# 5. Connector Usage Enforcement

## User Story
As a user, I want the interface to enforce connector usage rules, so that connectors can only be linked to agent nodes and not to event or output nodes.

**Estimated Time: 8 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Connectors (Tools) can only be attached to agent nodes.
2. The UI blocks attempts to connect connectors to event or output nodes.
3. Invalid connector attempts are visually indicated and explained.

# 6. Real-Time Data Model Synchronization

## User Story
As a user, I want all modifications in the visual designer to be accurately and instantly reflected in the underlying workflow data model, so that my changes are always saved and consistent.

**Estimated Time: 12 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All node and connection changes update the workflow data model in real time.
2. The data model remains consistent with the visual state of the canvas.
3. No changes are lost during editing sessions.

# 7. Desktop Browser Responsiveness and Accessibility

## User Story
As a user, I want the workflow designer interface to be responsive and accessible on desktop browsers, so that I can efficiently use it regardless of my device or accessibility needs.

**Estimated Time: 10 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The interface adapts to different desktop screen sizes and resolutions.
2. All controls and features are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
3. Visual indicators and controls are clear and usable for all users.

# 8. Workflow Execution Trigger (Play Button)

## User Story
As a user, I want a prominent 'Play' button in the workflow designer so that I can trigger the execution of the currently loaded workflow directly from the UI.

**Estimated Time: 10 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A 'Play' button is visible in the workflow designer UI.
2. The button is only enabled when the workflow passes validation (no critical errors).
3. Clicking the button triggers execution of the current workflow.
4. UI provides clear feedback when execution starts (e.g., loading indicator, status message).
5. The 'Play' button is disabled if the workflow is invalid or incomplete.
6. Triggered executions are reflected in the execution dashboard in real time.
