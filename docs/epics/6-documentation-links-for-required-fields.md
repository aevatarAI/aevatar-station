# AI Agent Workflow Engine â€“ Documentation Links for Required Fields

## 6. Documentation Links for Required Fields
**Version**
v0.7

**Objective:**  
Enhance user experience by providing direct links to official documentation for obtaining required field values (such as API keys, credentials, and configuration parameters), reducing user friction and support burden.

**Key Requirements:**
- **Contextual Documentation Links:**
  - Direct links to official vendor documentation for obtaining API keys, tokens, and credentials.
  - Links open in new tabs/windows to preserve user workflow context.

- **Comprehensive Coverage:**
  - **API Key Documentation:** Links to official guides for popular services:
    - Telegram Bot API key creation and management
    - OpenAI API key generation and usage
    - Discord bot token creation and permissions
    - Slack app credentials and OAuth setup
    - Google Cloud API credentials and service accounts
    - AWS access keys and IAM configuration
    - GitHub personal access tokens and app credentials

- **User Experience Features:**
  - Clear visual indicators for fields that require external documentation.
  - Step-by-step guidance that combines platform instructions with vendor documentation.
  - Quick copy functionality for generated configuration snippets and examples.
  - Progress tracking for multi-step setup processes requiring external documentation.
  - Validation helpers that verify successful completion of externally documented steps.

- **Content Management:**
  - Centralized management of documentation links with easy updates.
  - Version tracking for documentation links to ensure currency.
  - Automatic link validation to detect and flag broken or outdated documentation.
  - Support for multiple language versions of documentation when available.
  - Community contribution system for additional documentation links and improvements.

- **Platform Integration:**
  - Integration with the tooltip/help system already established in Epic 1 (Agent Configuration Management).

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Documentation Registry:**
  - Structured data store mapping field types to relevant documentation URLs.
  - Support for conditional documentation based on user selections or detected integrations.
  - API for dynamically updating documentation links without application deployment.
  - Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed documentation metadata.

- **Link Management:**
  - Automated link checking service to verify documentation availability.
  - Fallback mechanisms for temporarily unavailable documentation.
  - Support for versioned documentation links based on integration versions.
  - Content delivery optimization for fast documentation access.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Documentation links must not impact form performance or loading times.
- External documentation availability should not block user workflow progression.
- Link management system must be maintainable by non-technical team members.
- Integration must work consistently across all supported browsers and devices.
- Documentation link system must be extensible for future integrations and services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All relevant input fields display appropriate documentation links for obtaining required values.
- Documentation links direct users to the most current and accurate vendor documentation.
- Help system provides clear guidance on how to use obtained values within the platform.
- Link validation system successfully identifies and reports broken or outdated documentation.
- User testing confirms reduced friction in obtaining and configuring required field values.
- Documentation link system is easily maintainable and updateable by product team.
- Integration with existing tooltip/help system provides consistent user experience.
