# 1. Debug Pod Management

## Overview
Provides infrastructure for creating, managing, and reusing user-specific debug pods that serve as isolated execution environments for workflow testing.

### User Story

As an authenticated user, I want the system to automatically create and manage a personal debug pod when I enable debug mode, so that I can have an isolated testing environment that persists across multiple workflow debugging sessions.

**Time Estimate: 16 hours**

### Key Features
- **Pod Lifecycle Management:**
  - Automatic creation of user-specific debug pods on first debug mode activation
  - Pod persistence and reuse across multiple debugging sessions
  - Clean resource management and pod cleanup when sessions expire
- **Isolation & Security:**
  - Each user gets their own isolated debug environment
  - Debug pods are completely separated from production workflows
  - Secure pod-to-user mapping and authentication
- **Resource Management:**
  - Efficient resource allocation and monitoring
  - Automatic cleanup of inactive debug pods
  - Resource limits and quotas per user

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A user-specific debug pod is automatically created when debug mode is first activated
2. The same debug pod is reused for subsequent debug sessions by the same user
3. Debug pods are completely isolated from production environments and other users' pods
4. Debug pods are automatically cleaned up after a configurable period of inactivity
5. Resource usage is monitored and limited per user
6. Pod creation failures provide clear error messages to users
7. Only authenticated users can have debug pods created

# 2. Debug Mode Toggle & Basic UI

## Overview
Provides user interface controls for enabling/disabling debug mode with clear visual indicators and state management.

### User Story

As a workflow designer user, I want to easily toggle debug mode on and off from the workflow designer interface with clear visual feedback, so that I can switch between normal design mode and debugging mode as needed.

### Key Features
- **Debug Mode Controls:**
  - Toggle switch or button to enable/disable debug mode
  - Clear visual distinction when debug mode is active
  - Loading states during debug mode activation
- **Visual Indicators:**
  - Debug mode badge or indicator in the workflow designer
  - Status indicators for debug pod health and connectivity
  - Clear feedback when debug mode transitions succeed or fail
- **State Management:**
  - Persistent debug mode state during user session
  - Proper cleanup when debug mode is disabled
  - Handling of concurrent debug sessions

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can easily toggle debug mode on/off with a clear UI control
2. Debug mode state is visually indicated throughout the workflow designer interface  
3. Loading indicators show when debug mode is being activated or deactivated
4. Error messages are displayed if debug mode activation fails
5. Debug mode state persists during the user session until explicitly disabled
6. All debug UI elements are only visible to authenticated users
7. Debug mode toggle is disabled if user lacks debug permissions

# 3. Real-Time Data Streaming Infrastructure

## Overview
Establishes the technical infrastructure for streaming real-time data from workflow agents to the debugging interface using WebSocket or Server-Sent Events connections.

### User Story

As a workflow debugger, I want all agents in my workflow to stream their execution data (inputs, outputs, events, states) in real-time to the debug interface, so that I can observe what's happening during workflow execution as it occurs.

**Time Estimate: 20 hours**

### Key Features
- **Agent Instrumentation:**
  - All workflow agents are instrumented with debugging hooks
  - Capture and stream inputs, outputs, intermediate states, and events
  - Error and exception streaming with stack traces
- **Connection Management:**
  - WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections for real-time data delivery
  - Connection resilience with automatic reconnection
  - Efficient data serialization and compression
- **Data Streaming:**
  - Real-time streaming of agent execution events
  - Structured data format for consistent parsing
  - Rate limiting and buffering for high-frequency events

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All agents in debug mode automatically stream execution data in real-time
2. Streaming includes inputs, outputs, intermediate states, events, and errors
3. WebSocket/SSE connection is established when debug mode is activated
4. Connection automatically reconnects if temporarily lost
5. Streaming data is properly formatted and structured for UI consumption
6. High-frequency events are properly buffered and rate-limited
7. Streaming only occurs for the user's own debug session (no cross-user data leakage)
8. Streaming stops cleanly when debug mode is disabled

# 4. Interactive Workflow Execution

## Overview
Enables users to execute workflows directly from the debug interface with real-time progress tracking and execution control.

### User Story

As a workflow debugger, I want to execute workflows directly from the debug interface and see live progress updates, so that I can test my workflows in the debug environment and observe their behavior in real-time.

**Time Estimate: 12 hours**

### Key Features
- **Execution Controls:**
  - Play/execute button within the debug interface
  - Ability to trigger workflow execution in debug pod
  - Stop/cancel execution capability
- **Progress Tracking:**
  - Live progress indicators for each agent in the workflow
  - Real-time status updates (pending, running, completed, failed)
  - Execution timing and performance metrics
- **Integration:**
  - Seamless integration with debug pod infrastructure
  - Coordination with real-time streaming for live updates
  - Proper error handling and user feedback

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can execute workflows directly from the debug interface
2. Workflow execution runs in the user's dedicated debug pod
3. Live progress indicators show the current status of each agent
4. Users can stop/cancel workflow execution if needed
5. Execution results are immediately visible in the debug interface
6. Failed executions show clear error messages and failure points
7. Multiple workflow executions can be run sequentially in the same debug session
8. Execution is isolated from production workflows and other users' debug sessions

# 5. Live Timeline & Execution Visualization

## Overview
Provides visual representation of workflow execution with live updates, showing the flow of execution and current status of each agent in an intuitive timeline format.

### User Story

As a workflow debugger, I want to see a live timeline visualization of my workflow execution that updates in real-time, so that I can understand the execution flow, identify bottlenecks, and see which agents are currently running or have completed.

**Time Estimate: 16 hours**

### Key Features
- **Timeline Visualization:**
  - Visual timeline showing workflow execution progression
  - Live updates as agents start, progress, and complete
  - Clear indication of execution sequence and parallel processes
- **Agent Status Display:**
  - Visual indicators for each agent's current status
  - Execution timing and duration display
  - Highlighting of currently active agents

  - Parallel execution branch visualization
  - Error propagation and failure point highlighting

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Timeline visualization updates in real-time during workflow execution
2. Each agent's status (pending, running, completed, failed) is clearly indicated
3. Execution sequence and timing are visually represented
4. Parallel agent execution is clearly distinguished from sequential execution
5. Currently active agents are prominently highlighted
6. Failed agents and error propagation are clearly marked
7. Timeline persists after execution completion for post-execution analysis
8. Timeline is responsive and performs well with complex workflows
