# Unit Test Implementation Guide

When implementing unit tests:

1. Output: !!!"Unit Test Implemeting"!!!

2. Cover these essential test scenarios:
   - Positive: Verify expected behavior with valid inputs
   - Negative: Confirm appropriate handling of invalid inputs
   - Boundary: Test edge cases and limit values
   - Exception: Validate error handling and exceptions

3. Follow the AAA pattern:
   - Arrange: Set up test prerequisites
   - Act: Execute the code being tested
   - Assert: Verify expected outcomes

4. Quality requirements:
   - Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
   - Ensure all tests pass successfully
   - Verify builds with `dotnet test` without errors

5. Development constraints:
   - Modify test files only
   - Write isolated, independent tests
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario and expected outcome
   - Do not create additional unit test files
   - Creating additional files for helper classes is allowed
