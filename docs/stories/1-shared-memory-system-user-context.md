# Shared Memory System for User Context

## Overview
Implements a unified memory layer that enables all agents to share context, preferences, and learned information for individual users, creating a persistent and intelligent memory system that enhances agent capabilities and user experience continuity.

### User Story

As a user interacting with multiple AI agents across different sessions and requests, I want all agents to remember our previous conversations, my preferences, and learned information about me, so that each interaction builds upon previous knowledge and provides increasingly personalized and contextually relevant responses.

### Key Features

- **Persistent User Memory:**
  - Each user has a dedicated, encrypted memory space that persists across all sessions
  - Memory survives system restarts, deployments, and extended periods of inactivity
  - Automatic backup and recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss

- **Multi-Category Memory Management:**
  - **Conversational Memory:** Complete chat histories with context preservation
  - **Preference Memory:** User settings, communication style preferences, and behavioral patterns
  - **Knowledge Memory:** Facts about the user, their domain expertise, and interests
  - **Task Memory:** Ongoing projects, goals, and progress tracking across sessions

- **Real-Time Agent Memory Access:**
  - All agents can instantly access and update shared memory during interactions
  - Concurrent access protection with optimistic locking and conflict resolution
  - Memory updates are immediately available to other agents in the same user context

- **Intelligent Memory Operations:**
  - Semantic search across all memory content using embeddings
  - Automatic categorization and tagging of new memory entries
  - Context-aware memory retrieval based on current conversation topics
  - Smart memory summarization to prevent information overload

- **Privacy and Security Controls:**
  - End-to-end encryption for all memory data at rest and in transit
  - User-controlled memory categories with granular sharing permissions
  - Complete audit trail of all memory access and modifications
  - GDPR-compliant data handling with user rights for access, correction, and deletion

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Sub-100ms memory read operations for real-time conversations
  - Intelligent caching with automatic cache invalidation
  - Memory compression for efficient storage utilization
  - Pagination for large memory datasets to maintain responsiveness

### Technical Implementation Details

- **Storage Architecture:**
  - Primary storage using MongoDB for structured data and metadata
  - Vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) for semantic search capabilities
  - Redis cache layer for frequently accessed memories
  - Blob storage (Azure/AWS) for large files and attachments

- **API Design:**
  - RESTful API with GraphQL support for complex queries
  - WebSocket connections for real-time memory synchronization
  - SDK integration with existing agent framework
  - Rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse

- **Data Model:**
  ```
  UserMemory {
    userId: string,
    category: MemoryCategory,
    content: object,
    metadata: {
      createdAt: timestamp,
      updatedAt: timestamp,
      agentId: string,
      importance: number,
      tags: string[],
      expiresAt?: timestamp
    },
    embedding?: vector,
    accessLevel: PrivacyLevel
  }
  ```

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Memory Persistence:**
   - When I have a conversation with an agent, all context and information is automatically stored in my personal memory
   - When I return after days or weeks, agents remember our previous conversations and can reference past interactions
   - Memory survives system maintenance, updates, and restarts without data loss

2. **Cross-Agent Context Sharing:**
   - When I switch from one agent to another, the new agent has access to relevant context from previous agents
   - Agents can reference information learned by other agents in previous sessions
   - Context handoffs between agents are seamless and don't require me to repeat information

3. **Intelligent Memory Retrieval:**
   - Agents can find relevant information from my memory based on the current conversation topic
   - Memory search results are ranked by relevance and recency
   - Agents can summarize relevant past context without overwhelming me with details

4. **User Control and Privacy:**
   - I can view all information stored in my memory through a user-friendly interface
   - I can edit, delete, or modify any memory entries
   - I can control which categories of memory different agents can access
   - I receive clear notifications about what information is being stored

5. **Performance Requirements:**
   - Memory operations don't cause noticeable delays in agent responses (< 100ms)
   - The system handles concurrent access when I'm using multiple agents simultaneously
   - Memory search and retrieval remain fast even with large amounts of stored data

6. **Security and Compliance:**
   - All my memory data is encrypted and secure from unauthorized access
   - I can export all my memory data in a standard format
   - I can request complete deletion of my memory data (right to be forgotten)
   - The system maintains audit logs of who accessed my memory and when

7. **Integration and Reliability:**
   - Existing agents work with the memory system without breaking changes
   - The memory system has 99.9% uptime and high availability
   - Failed memory operations are handled gracefully without disrupting conversations
   - Memory synchronization across distributed agents is consistent and reliable

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **Memory Conflicts:** When multiple agents try to update the same memory simultaneously, the system uses conflict resolution to merge or prioritize updates
- **Storage Limits:** Users receive notifications when approaching memory limits and can archive or delete old memories
- **Data Corruption:** Automatic detection and recovery of corrupted memory with fallback to previous versions
- **Privacy Violations:** System automatically detects and prevents storage of sensitive information (passwords, payment details)
- **Network Issues:** Agents degrade gracefully when memory system is unavailable, using local session context as fallback

### Success Metrics

- **User Satisfaction:** 90%+ of users report improved agent interactions due to memory continuity
- **Context Accuracy:** 95%+ of agent references to past information are accurate and relevant
- **Performance:** 99% of memory operations complete within 100ms response time
- **Adoption:** 80%+ of active agents utilize the memory system for enhanced interactions
- **Privacy Compliance:** Zero privacy violations or unauthorized access incidents
