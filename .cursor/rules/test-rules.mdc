Output `Running and Fixing Unit Tests`

Use context7 for Orleans related issues.
Use max context to understand the problems in detail.

You MUST iterate implementing and fixing unit tests until all the following criteria are met:
- All unit test cases passes.
- Execute `dotnet test` and it yields no compile error.
Do not fix warnings.

Use openmemory to get relevant context.

For file specific unit test, run command like these examples:
- `dotnet test framework/test/Aevatar.Core.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~OrleansGrainProxyGeneratorTests" --verbosity normal`
- `dotnet test framework/test/Aevatar.Core.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AgentPluginTests" --verbosity normal`
