# AI Agent Workflow Engine â€“ Product Specifications

## 1. Visual Workflow Designer (Drag-and-Drop Interface)
**Objective:**  
Empower users to intuitively build, modify, and comprehend agent workflows through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface.

**Key Requirements:**
- Canvas-based, node-centric environment for assembling workflows.
- A palette featuring agent actions, triggers, and connectors.
- Ability to link nodes to establish execution logic, including sequential, parallel, and conditional flows.
- Features for zooming, panning, and undoing/redoing actions.
- Instant validation of workflow integrity (e.g., detection of unconnected nodes).
- Optimized for desktop browser responsiveness.
- The designer must enable users to choose nodes from these groups when constructing workflows:
  - **Agent Node:** AI agents such as Summarizer, Retriever, Planner
  - **Event Node:** Triggers like Time-based or Webhook events
  - **Output Node:** Actions such as Save to DB, Send Email, or Webhook
- Each node group should have a distinct visual style in the palette.
- Connectors (Tools) should be available to attach to agent nodes, offering extra functionalities (e.g., search, external API integration).
- The interface should allow users to filter or search node types by their category.
- **Connector Usage Rule:**
  - Connectors (Tools) are permitted only to link into Agent Nodes. They cannot connect directly to Event Nodes or Output Nodes.
  - The UI must enforce this rule, blocking any invalid connections.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can add, modify, and remove nodes and their connections.
- The system visually highlights invalid workflow configurations.
- All modifications are accurately represented in the underlying workflow data model.

## 2. Debugger Overlay (Read-Only State Inspection)
**Objective:**
Allow users to inspect the agent's state after workflow execution for troubleshooting and validation.

**Key Requirements:**
- Debug mode toggle in the workflow designer.
- Overlay displays agent state (inputs, outputs, intermediate data) post-execution.
- No step-through or breakpoints; read-only inspection only.
- Access restricted to authenticated users.
- Clear indication when in debug mode.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Only authenticated users can access debug overlay.
- Users can view state snapshots for each node after execution.
- No ability to modify state from the overlay.

## 3. Workflow Save/Load Functionality via UI
**Objective:**
Allow users to persist and retrieve workflow configurations.

**Key Requirements:**
- Save current workflow to backend (with versioning).
- Load existing workflows into the designer.
- UI feedback for save/load success or failure.
- Support for workflow templates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can save and load workflows without data loss.
- Version history is accessible (if implemented).

---

## 4. Execution Progress Tracking Dashboard
**Objective:**
Provide real-time visibility into workflow execution status and progress.

**Key Requirements:**
- Dashboard view showing running, completed, and failed workflows.
- Per-node execution status (pending, running, succeeded, failed).
- Execution logs and error messages.
- Filtering and search capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can monitor workflow execution in real time.
- Errors and progress are clearly displayed.

---

## 5. Workflow Template Library
**Objective:**
Accelerate user onboarding and workflow creation with pre-built automation blueprints.

**Key Requirements:**
- Library of common workflow templates.
- Template preview and description.
- One-click import into user's workspace.
- Support for community-contributed templates (optional).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can browse, preview, and import templates.
- Imported templates are editable.

---

## 6. Plugin Management Page
**Objective:**
Enable users to upload, manage, and utilize plugins, making them available as agent nodes within the visual workflow designer.

**Key Requirements:**
- Dedicated page for uploading and managing plugins (e.g., custom AI agents, tools).
- List view of all uploaded plugins with metadata (name, version, description, status).
- Ability to upload new plugins and update or remove existing ones.
- Validation and feedback for plugin upload (success, failure, compatibility).
- Plugins that pass validation should automatically appear as selectable agent nodes in the workflow designer palette.
- Search and filter functionality for plugins.
- Support for plugin versioning and rollback.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can upload, update, and remove plugins via the management page.
- Successfully uploaded plugins are available as agent nodes in the workflow designer.
- Invalid or incompatible plugins are clearly flagged and not loaded into the designer.
- Users receive clear feedback on plugin management actions.
