# Aevatar Platform — Product Summary (Verified)

*Empower developers to build, run, and evolve intelligent, event-sourced AI agents at scale.*

---

## 1. Executive Overview
Aevatar combines **Aevatar Framework** (distributed actor core) and **Aevatar Station** (developer & ops tooling) to give teams a turnkey way to create AI-driven micro-services called *GAgents*.  Under the hood, the platform leverages Microsoft Orleans' virtual-actor model, event sourcing, and a pluggable stream layer (Kafka or in-memory).  Real-time client interaction is delivered through an out-of-the-box SignalR hub.

> **Verification status:** All architectural claims below are confirmed by repository source code unless otherwise noted *(see `docs/factual_verification.md`).*

## 2. What Makes Aevatar Stand Out

### 2.1 Scalable Virtual Actors *(Confirmed)*
* `GAgentBase` inherits from `JournaledGrain<TState,…>` 14:25:framework/src/Aevatar.Core/GAgentBase.cs  
* Dynamic placement & rebalance provided by Orleans → add silos, increase throughput.

Aevatar builds on Orleans' virtual-actor model, so every GAgent is a lightweight grain that activates on demand and is automatically re-balanced across silos. Add or remove nodes and the runtime transparently redistributes activations, delivering linear horizontal scalability without sticky-session plumbing.

### 2.2 Event-Sourced State & Audit *(Confirmed)*
* `[LogConsistencyProvider("LogStorage")]` attribute + MongoDB implementation keep an immutable event log.
* Time-travel debugging and compliant audit trails come for free.

Each agent's state is persisted as an immutable event log via Orleans' log-consistency provider (backed by MongoDB by default). This gives developers full time-travel debugging, deterministic replay, and compliance-grade audit trails without implementing custom snapshot logic.

### 2.3 Realtime API via SignalR *(Confirmed)*
* `AevatarSignalRHub : Hub` exposes methods like `PublishEventAsync` for millisecond latency messaging.

A built-in ASP.NET Core SignalR hub (`/api/agent/aevatarHub`) exposes methods such as `PublishEventAsync`, allowing web or mobile clients to push commands and receive state changes in milliseconds—eliminating polling or additional gateway services.

### 2.4 Polyglot Stream Provider *(Confirmed)*
* `OrleansHostExtension` wires `siloBuilder.AddKafka("Aevatar")` when configured; otherwise falls back to in-memory streams.

Stream traffic between agents—or between agents and external systems—can be routed through Kafka for production scale or an in-memory provider for local testing. Switching transports is a single configuration change thanks to the pluggable provider design.

### 2.5 Hierarchical Agent Composition *(Confirmed)*
* Parent/child registration in `RegisterAsync`, `RegisterManyAsync` enables complex workflows to be modeled as trees of agents.

GAgents can dynamically register children or entire sub-trees using `RegisterAsync` and `RegisterManyAsync`. This enables complex workflows—pipelines, trees, or meshes—while each agent owns its own state and lifecycle, promoting separation of concerns and composability.

### 2.6 Operational Dashboard *(Confirmed)*
* Built-in Orleans Dashboard exposed via configurable port for live cluster metrics.

The Orleans Dashboard ships with the silo and surfaces live metrics such as activation counts, CPU usage, request throughput, and grain-level logs, giving operators instant visibility without deploying a separate monitoring stack.

### 2.7 Environmental Flexibility *(Partially Confirmed)*
* Environment variables reference Kubernetes (`POD_IP`, `ORLEANS_CLUSTER_ID`) indicating deployment awareness.  
* **Note**: Docker/K8s manifests are *not* included in the repo; operators can supply their own.

Startup code detects Kubernetes-style environment variables (`POD_IP`, `ORLEANS_CLUSTER_ID`) but runs equally well on Docker or bare-metal. Teams can promote the same binaries from laptop to cluster with zero code changes.

### 2.8 Horizontal Cost Efficiency *(Plausible)*
* Orleans activations are lightweight and billed per node; cost scales with compute resources.  
* No hard data or benchmarks are present—teams should measure for their workload.

Virtual actors activate only when messaged and passivate when idle, so compute usage—and cloud cost—tracks real workload. Scaling is node-based rather than replica-based, avoiding the overhead of per-service containers or functions.

## 3. Technical Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Actor Runtime | Microsoft Orleans 8 (Virtual Actors) |
| Event Store | MongoDB (pluggable) |
| Stream Provider | Kafka or In-Memory |
| Cache / Cluster DB | Redis |
| Realtime Gateway | ASP.NET Core + SignalR |
| Auth & API | ASP.NET Core, OpenIddict, ABP Framework |

---

## 4. Typical Use-Cases
* Conversational AI agents that need persistent memory
* IoT fleets or robotics swarms requiring command & telemetry channels
* Digital-twin simulations with thousands of entities
* Workflow orchestration where every state change must be auditable

---

## 5. Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the monorepo
git clone https://github.com/aevatarAI/aevatar-station.git
cd aevatar-station/station/src

# Run database migrations
cd Aevatar.DbMigrator && dotnet run && cd ..

# Start the Orleans silo
cd Aevatar.Silo && dotnet run

# Start the HTTP API
cd ../Aevatar.HttpApi.Host && dotnet run
```
Once running, connect a WebSocket client to `/api/agent/aevatarHub` to publish events in real time.

---

## 6. Roadmap & Opportunities
* **Containerization assets** – Provide Helm charts & Docker Compose for one-line cloud deployment.  *(community help welcome!)*
* **Benchmark suite** – Publish performance data for common agent workloads.

## 7. Aevatar vs. LangGraph
| Feature | Aevatar Platform | LangGraph (LangChain ecosystem) |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Primary Language / Runtime | C# / .NET 8, Microsoft Orleans virtual-actors | Python, built on top of LangChain primitives |
| Concurrency Model | Distributed virtual actors (grains) auto-balanced across silos → horizontal scale-out | In-process async DAG; parallelism limited by Python event loop unless user adds external infra |
| State Persistence | Event-sourced with immutable log (MongoDB, pluggable DBs) **built-in** | Ephemeral by default; developers wire custom storage for memory/state |
| Real-Time Client Connectivity | SignalR hub (`/api/agent/aevatarHub`) supports bi-directional WebSocket messaging | No built-in realtime gateway—requires separate API layer |
| Deployment Footprint | Runs on Docker / VMs / Kubernetes; single binary per service, dashboard included | Python package; scaling & ops left to user (e.g. Ray, Dask, serverless) |
| Built-in Infrastructure Adapters | Kafka streams, Redis cache, MongoDB event store, Orleans Dashboard | Integrates LangChain toolset (vector DBs, LLM providers) but no message bus/DB opinions |
| Hierarchical Composition | Parent/child GAgents with dynamic registration (tree or mesh topologies) | Graph nodes & edges (DAG/cyclic) but no concept of distributed ownership |
| Audit & Compliance | Full event log replay; state versioning | Depends on user-supplied callbacks/storage |
| Auth & Multi-Tenant API | ABP + OpenIddict server included | Not included |
| Ideal Use-Cases | Production-grade, multi-tenant AI backends needing strong consistency, realtime UX | Rapid prototyping of LLM workflows, research notebooks |

**Key Takeaway:** LangGraph excels at quick Python-based experimentation, while **Aevatar** provides a production-ready, cloud-native runtime with persistent state, horizontal scalability, and realtime APIs baked in. Teams that need enterprise-grade reliability, audit trails, and .NET ecosystem integration will benefit from Aevatar's opinionated infrastructure stack.

Build once, scale effortlessly, evolve rapidly — **Aevatar** puts production-ready AI agents within reach of every .NET developer.
