# Aevatar.WebHook.Deploy

This project provides deployment utilities and tools for Aevatar webhooks.

## Overview

`Aevatar.WebHook.Deploy` contains deployment configurations, infrastructure-as-code templates, and utilities for deploying and managing webhook endpoints in various environments. It serves as a bridge between the webhook SDK and infrastructure components.

## Key Features

- Deployment templates and scripts
- Infrastructure-as-code definitions
- Environment configuration management
- Deployment validation tools
- Continuous integration/deployment hooks
- Telemetry setup for deployed webhooks

## Dependencies

The project references the following key project:

- `Aevatar.Application.Contracts` - Application contracts needed for webhook deployment

## Project Structure

- **Templates/**: Infrastructure-as-code templates for different environments
- **Services/**: Deployment service implementations
- **Models/**: Deployment configuration models
- **Validators/**: Deployment validation utilities

## Usage

This library can be used to:

1. Deploy webhook endpoints to different environments
2. Manage webhook configuration across environments
3. Validate webhook endpoints before deployment
4. Generate deployment scripts and templates

Example deployment code:

```csharp
public class WebhookDeployer
{
    private readonly IWebhookDeployService _deployService;
    
    public WebhookDeployer(IWebhookDeployService deployService)
    {
        _deployService = deployService;
    }
    
    public async Task DeployWebhookAsync(WebhookDeploymentOptions options)
    {
        // Validate the deployment configuration
        await _deployService.ValidateDeploymentAsync(options);
        
        // Generate deployment artifacts
        var artifacts = await _deployService.GenerateDeploymentArtifactsAsync(options);
        
        // Deploy the webhook
        var deploymentResult = await _deployService.DeployAsync(artifacts, options);
        
        // Verify the deployment
        await _deployService.VerifyDeploymentAsync(deploymentResult);
    }
}
```

## Deployment Process

The webhook deployment process follows these steps:

1. **Preparation**: Load deployment configuration from source control
2. **Validation**: Validate the configuration against target environment
3. **Artifact Generation**: Generate necessary deployment artifacts
4. **Deployment**: Apply the artifacts to the target environment
5. **Verification**: Verify the deployed webhook is functioning correctly
6. **Telemetry**: Set up monitoring and alerting for the webhook

## CI/CD Integration

The deployment tools integrate with CI/CD pipelines via:

- Environment-specific configuration files
- Pipeline variable substitution
- Deployment approval workflows
- Post-deployment validation steps

## Configuration

Environment-specific configuration is managed through configuration files that can be customized for each target environment:

```json
{
  "Webhook": {
    "Name": "OrderProcessingWebhook",
    "Environment": "Production",
    "ApiVersion": "v1",
    "Resources": {
      "MemoryLimit": "256Mi",
      "CpuLimit": "200m"
    },
    "Replicas": 2,
    "Monitoring": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "AlertThresholds": {
        "ErrorRate": 0.01,
        "ResponseTime": 500
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Logging

The deployment tools log important operations and errors at appropriate checkpoints to facilitate debugging and monitoring of the deployment process.
