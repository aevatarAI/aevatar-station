# AI Agent Workflow Engine â€“ Auto-Generated Domain Names

## 4. Auto-Generated Domain Names for New Projects
**Version**
v0.7

**Objective:**  
Streamline project creation by automatically generating domain names for new projects, eliminating the need for users to manually input domain information during the project setup process.

**Key Requirements:**
- **Automatic Domain Generation:**
  - System automatically generates unique, meaningful domain names when a new project is created.
  - Domain generation algorithm combines project name, organization identifier, and random elements to ensure uniqueness.
  - Generated domains follow standard naming conventions (lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens, max 63 characters).
  - Domain validation ensures generated names are available and compliant with DNS standards.
  - Fallback generation strategies if initial domain name conflicts occur.

- **Domain Naming Strategy:**
  - Primary format: `{project-slug}-{org-identifier}-{random-suffix}.{base-domain}`
  - Secondary format for conflicts: `{project-slug}-{timestamp}-{hash}.{base-domain}`
  - Configurable base domain per environment (e.g., `.aevatar.dev`, `.aevatar.com`)
  - Support for custom domain templates per organization tier or configuration.
  - Meaningful naming that reflects project purpose and ownership.

- **User Experience:**
  - Project creation form removes manual domain input field entirely.
  - Generated domain is displayed to users after successful project creation.
  - Users can view and copy their project's domain from project settings or dashboard.
  - Clear indication of domain ownership and usage within project context.
  - Option to view domain generation history and understand naming logic.

- **Domain Management:**
  - Generated domains are immediately reserved and associated with the project.
  - Domain records are created in DNS infrastructure automatically.
  - Support for domain lifecycle management (activation, deactivation, transfer).
  - Integration with existing project deletion workflows to clean up unused domains.
  - Audit trail for all domain generation and management activities.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Domain generation must complete within 3 seconds during project creation.
- Generated domains must be globally unique across the entire platform.
- Domain names must comply with RFC 1123 DNS naming standards.
- Support for both single-tenant and multi-tenant deployment scenarios.
- Integration with existing DNS infrastructure and domain registrar APIs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- New project creation automatically generates unique domain names without user input.
- Generated domains are immediately usable and properly configured in DNS.
- Users can easily identify and access their project's generated domain.
- Domain generation never fails due to naming conflicts (fallback strategies work).
- Project creation flow is simplified and faster without manual domain input.
- Generated domains follow consistent, predictable naming patterns.
- Domain cleanup occurs automatically when projects are deleted.
- All domain operations are logged and auditable for troubleshooting.
