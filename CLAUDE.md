# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture Overview

This is a multi-solution .NET repository with three main components:
- **framework/** - Core distributed actor framework built on Microsoft Orleans
- **station/** - Main application platform for AI agent management  
- **signalR/** - Real-time communication layer

The system uses event sourcing, actor model patterns (Orleans), and supports multiple databases (MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, Elasticsearch).

## Common Development Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
# Build entire solution
dotnet build

# Database migration (run first)
cd station/src/Aevatar.DbMigrator
dotnet run

# Start services (in order)
cd station/src/Aevatar.AuthServer && dotnet run
cd station/src/Aevatar.Silo && dotnet run  
cd station/src/Aevatar.HttpApi.Host && dotnet run
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests in a module
cd framework  # or station/signalR
dotnet test

# Run with code coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings ../CodeCoverage.runsettings

# Run specific test project
dotnet test test/Aevatar.Core.Tests/Aevatar.Core.Tests.csproj
```

### Linting and Type Checking
The project uses standard .NET tooling. Run these commands before committing:
```bash
dotnet format
dotnet build --no-incremental
```

## Key Architectural Concepts

### GAgent Framework
The core abstraction for distributed agents (actors) that provides:
- Event sourcing via Orleans' JournaledGrain
- State management with automatic persistence
- Pub/sub messaging between agents
- Hierarchical agent relationships

Agents inherit from `GAgentBase<TState, TEvent>` and use attributes:
- `[GAgent]` - Marks a class as an agent
- `[EventHandler]` - Marks methods that handle specific events
- `[LogConsistencyProvider]` - Configures event store
- `[StorageProvider]` - Configures state persistence

### Orleans Configuration
The system uses Orleans for distributed actor model:
- Clustering: Redis or MongoDB
- Grain Storage: Redis or MongoDB  
- Stream Provider: Kafka or in-memory
- Dashboard available at port 8080

### Event Flow
1. Client connects via SignalR to `/api/agent/aevatarHub`
2. SignalRGAgent acts as proxy between SignalR and Orleans grains
3. Events are routed to target GAgents via Orleans
4. State changes are persisted via event sourcing
5. Responses flow back through the same path

## Project Structure

### Core Libraries (framework/src/)
- `Aevatar.Core.Abstractions` - Core interfaces
- `Aevatar.Core` - GAgent base implementations
- `Aevatar.EventSourcing.Core` - Event sourcing infrastructure
- `Aevatar.Plugins` - Plugin management system

### Application Services (station/src/)
- `Aevatar.Silo` - Orleans silo host
- `Aevatar.HttpApi.Host` - REST API host
- `Aevatar.AuthServer` - Authentication server
- `Aevatar.SignalR` - Real-time communication hub

### Testing
- Framework: xUnit
- Assertions: Shouldly, FluentAssertions
- Mocking: Moq, FakeItEasy, NSubstitute
- Orleans Testing: Orleans TestKit
- Coverage: Coverlet with Cobertura format

## Environment Variables
Key environment variables for Kubernetes deployment:
- `POD_IP` - Pod IP address
- `ORLEANS_CLUSTER_ID` - Cluster identifier
- `ORLEANS_SERVICE_ID` - Service identifier
- `SILO_NAME_PATTERN` - Pattern for SiloNamePatternPlacement

## Database Connections
Configure in `appsettings.json`:
- MongoDB: Primary data store and Orleans clustering
- Redis: Caching and Orleans clustering/storage
- Kafka: Event streaming
- Elasticsearch: Search and analytics
- Neo4j: Graph database (if used)

# Role
- You are an expert C# software developer who specialises in maintenability, scalability and clean code.

# Writing code

- CRITICAL: NEVER USE --no-verify WHEN COMMITTING CODE
- We prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones, even if the latter are more concise or performant. Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.
- Make the smallest reasonable changes to get to the desired outcome. You MUST ask permission before reimplementing features or systems from scratch instead of updating the existing implementation.
- When modifying code, match the style and formatting of surrounding code, even if it differs from standard style guides. Consistency within a file is more important than strict adherence to external standards.
- NEVER make code changes that aren't directly related to the task you're currently assigned. If you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, document it in a new issue instead of fixing it immediately.
- NEVER remove code comments unless you can prove that they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and should be preserved even if they seem redundant or unnecessary to you.
- All code files should start with a brief 2 line comment explaining what the file does. Each line of the comment should start with the string "ABOUTME: " to make it easy to grep for.
- When writing comments, avoid referring to temporal context about refactors or recent changes. Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is, not how it evolved or was recently changed.
- NEVER implement a mock mode for testing or for any purpose. We always use real data and real APIs, never mock implementations.
- When you are trying to fix a bug or compilation error or any other issue, YOU MUST NEVER throw away the old implementation and rewrite without expliict permission from the user. If you are going to do this, YOU MUST STOP and get explicit permission from the user.
- NEVER name things as 'improved' or 'new' or 'enhanced', etc. Code naming should be evergreen. What is new today will be "old" someday.

# Getting help

- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- If you're having trouble with something, it's ok to stop and ask for help. Especially if it's something your human might be better at.

# Testing

- Tests MUST cover the functionality being implemented.
- NEVER ignore the output of the system or the tests - Logs and messages often contain CRITICAL information.
- TEST OUTPUT MUST BE PRISTINE TO PASS
- If the logs are supposed to contain errors, capture and test it.
- NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have unit tests, integration tests, AND end-to-end tests. If you believe a test type doesn't apply, you need the human to say exactly "I AUTHORIZE YOU TO SKIP WRITING TESTS THIS TIME"

## We practice TDD. That means:

- Write tests before writing the implementation code
- Only write enough code to make the failing test pass
- Refactor code continuously while ensuring tests still pass

### TDD Implementation Process

- Write a failing test that defines a desired function or improvement
- Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
- Write minimal code to make the test pass
- Run the test to confirm success
- Refactor code to improve design while keeping tests green
- Repeat the cycle for each new feature or bugfix

# Coding Best Practices

Output: `!!!Coding in progress!!!`

You are an expert C# backend developer specialised in backend scalability, code maintainability and agentic workflow.

Use context7 for Orleans related issues.
ALWAYS use openmemory to search for related fixes or changes.

Breakdown complex tasks into manageable parts, use Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive principles. Use sequentialthinking to support this.

After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task.

Keep answers concise and direct.
Prioritize technical details over generic advice.
Create new file for a new class.

Iterate until the implementation adheres to the following:
- SOLID principles
- Add logging at important checkpoints of the code
- Ensure scalability and performance

Whenever `dotnet build` or `dotnet run` is executed, fix the compile error if there are any.
When referencing code, make sure that the referenced code exists.
Whenever a fix or a feature is completed. Write into openmemory the summary including the following:
- The reason for the fix/feature
- The fix/feature implemented
- All reference files modified for the fix/feature

# Testing Best Practices

Use context7 for Orleans related issues.

When working on unit tests, do the following:
1. Analyse what the method does, breakdown and create extensive test cases
2. Make sure to cover the following test cases:
    1. Positive Test Cases
    2. Negative Test Cases
    3. Boundary Test Cases
    4. Exception Test Cases
3. Use Arrange, Act and Assert format. 
4. Implement using SOLID principles.
5. Only edit test files.

Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.

You MUST iterate implementing and fixing unit tests until all the following criteria are met:
- All unit test cases passes.
- Execute `dotnet test` and it yields no compile error.
Do not fix warnings.

Use openmemory to get relevant context.

For file specific unit test, run command like these examples:
- `dotnet test framework/test/Aevatar.Core.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~OrleansGrainProxyGeneratorTests" --verbosity normal`
- `dotnet test framework/test/Aevatar.Core.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AgentPluginTests" --verbosity normal`
