# TypeMetadataService Test Cases

## AgentTypeMetadata Model Class
**NOTE: This section has been removed as per updated testing guidelines. AgentTypeMetadata is a simple data model with auto-properties and no business logic, validation rules, or custom behavior. Testing basic C# property get/set operations and List<T> framework behavior provides no business value.**

**The Orleans serialization behavior for AgentTypeMetadata is already covered by the TypeMetadataGrain integration tests where objects are actually serialized/deserialized in real scenarios.**

## ITypeMetadataService Interface
**NOTE: This section has been removed as per updated testing guidelines. Interface testing provides no business value when:**
- **Interface has no implementation logic** - Only method signatures and contracts
- **Compiler enforcement** - C# compiler already validates interface implementation
- **Contract verification** - Already covered by concrete implementation tests
- **Mock behavior testing** - Tests Moq framework behavior, not business logic

**The interface contract is validated through:**
- **Concrete implementation tests** - TypeMetadataService tests verify actual behavior
- **Integration tests** - Real usage scenarios exercise the interface contract
- **Compiler verification** - Ensures implementations conform to interface signatures
