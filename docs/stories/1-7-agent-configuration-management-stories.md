# 1. Default Input Values for New Agent Nodes

## User Story
As a user creating a new agent node, I want the system to automatically populate all required fields with appropriate default values, so that I can immediately save and use the agent without having to manually configure every field.

**Estimated Time: 16 hours**

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I create a new agent node  
**When** the agent node is added to the workflow  
**Then** all required fields are pre-populated with contextually appropriate default values  

**Given** I have a new agent node with default values  
**When** I examine the default values  
**Then** the values are specific to the agent type and based on common use cases  

**Given** I have a new agent node with default values  
**When** I attempt to save the agent node  
**Then** I can immediately save the agent node without validation errors  

**Given** I view the default values in the configuration  
**When** I examine the interface  
**Then** default values are visually distinguishable from user-entered values (e.g., placeholder styling)  

**Given** I have modified a field from its default value  
**When** I want to revert it  
**Then** I can reset any field back to its default value using a reset option  

**Given** the system populates default values  
**When** I use the agent node in execution  
**Then** default values pass all validation rules and don't cause runtime errors

# 2. Auto-Save Configuration Changes

## User Story
As a user configuring agent nodes, I want all my configuration changes to be automatically saved without clicking a save button, so that I never lose my work and can focus on building workflows.

**Estimated Time: 20 hours**

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I change any configuration value  
**When** I complete the change  
**Then** the change is automatically saved within 2 seconds  

**Given** I make configuration changes  
**When** the auto-save process occurs  
**Then** I receive visual feedback showing save status (saving, saved, error)  

**Given** an auto-save operation fails  
**When** the failure occurs  
**Then** I am notified with a clear error message and automatic retry occurs  

**Given** I interact with any form inputs  
**When** I change text, dropdowns, or checkboxes  
**Then** all form inputs trigger auto-save behavior  

**Given** I make rapid configuration changes  
**When** multiple changes occur quickly  
**Then** auto-save operations are debounced to prevent excessive server requests  

**Given** I navigate away from a configuration and return  
**When** I return to the configuration  
**Then** changes are preserved if I navigate away and return to the configuration  

**Given** I am working on my workflow  
**When** I view the overall workflow status  
**Then** a global save indicator shows the overall workflow save state

# 3. Real-Time Configuration Validation

## User Story
As a user configuring agent nodes, I want immediate validation feedback as I enter values, so that I can quickly identify and fix configuration errors before they cause runtime issues.

**Estimated Time: 14 hours**

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I enter invalid values in configuration fields  
**When** I input the values  
**Then** I receive immediate visual feedback with error styling  

**Given** I am entering configuration values  
**When** I type or change values  
**Then** validation occurs in real-time as I type or change values  

**Given** I encounter validation errors  
**When** I view the error indicators  
**Then** error messages provide specific guidance on how to fix the issue  

**Given** I have valid configurations  
**When** I complete valid inputs  
**Then** valid configurations are indicated with positive visual feedback (green checkmarks)  

**Given** I am working with configuration forms  
**When** I view the form fields  
**Then** required fields are clearly marked and validated  

**Given** I attempt to save configurations with critical errors  
**When** I try to save  
**Then** the system prevents saving of configurations with critical validation errors  

**Given** I am configuring different types of agents  
**When** I interact with various fields  
**Then** validation rules are appropriate for each agent type and field  

**Given** I have configurations that may cause runtime issues  
**When** I review my configuration  
**Then** warning indicators appear for configurations that may cause runtime issues

# 4. Configuration Change History

## User Story
As a user making configuration changes, I want the ability to undo and redo my recent changes, so that I can easily recover from mistakes and experiment with different configurations.

**Estimated Time: 12 hours**

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have made configuration changes  
**When** I want to undo changes  
**Then** I can undo the last 10 configuration changes using Ctrl+Z or an undo button  

**Given** I have undone configuration changes  
**When** I want to redo them  
**Then** I can redo undone changes using Ctrl+Y or a redo button  

**Given** I want to see my recent changes  
**When** I access the history  
**Then** the system maintains a visual history of recent configuration changes  

**Given** I am working with multiple agent nodes  
**When** I use undo/redo operations  
**Then** undo/redo operations are scoped to individual agent nodes  

**Given** I make changes and auto-save occurs  
**When** I use undo/redo  
**Then** the undo/redo state is preserved during auto-save operations  

**Given** I am working with configuration changes  
**When** I check the availability of undo/redo operations  
**Then** clear visual indicators show when undo/redo operations are available  

**Given** I navigate away from the workflow and return  
**When** I return to the workflow  
**Then** configuration history is cleared when I navigate away from the workflow
