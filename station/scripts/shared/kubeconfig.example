# Kubeconfig Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the kubeconfig that will be generated automatically
when you run the regression tests using Docker Compose.

## How it works:

1. When you run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.regression.yml up`, the K3s 
   container will automatically generate a kubeconfig file in this directory.

2. The generated kubeconfig file is used by the test services to connect to the
   K3s Kubernetes cluster.

3. The actual kubeconfig file is ignored by git for security reasons.

## DO NOT:
- Commit any actual kubeconfig files to the repository
- Share kubeconfig files as they contain sensitive authentication credentials

## Running the tests:
From the station/scripts directory:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.regression.yml up
```

The kubeconfig will be automatically created at: `station/scripts/shared/kubeconfig`
