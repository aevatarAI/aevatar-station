# Agent Capabilities Epic Specifications

This document outlines the specifications for enhancing agent capabilities within the Aevatar platform, focusing on advanced memory management, context sharing, and persistent state management across agent interactions.

## 1. Shared Memory System for User Context
**Objective:**  
Enable seamless information sharing and context preservation across all agents and requests for individual users, creating a unified memory layer that enhances agent performance and user experience continuity.

**Key Requirements:**
- **User-Scoped Memory Storage:**
  - Each user maintains a dedicated memory space isolated from other users
  - Memory persists across sessions, requests, and different agent interactions
  - Support for structured data storage (key-value pairs, documents, embeddings)
  
- **Multi-Agent Memory Access:**
  - All agents within a user's context can read from and write to the shared memory
  - Real-time synchronization of memory updates across concurrent agent sessions
  - Conflict resolution mechanisms for simultaneous memory modifications
  
- **Memory Types and Categories:**
  - **Conversational Memory:** Chat history, context, and dialogue state
  - **Preference Memory:** User settings, preferences, and behavioral patterns
  - **Knowledge Memory:** Facts, learned information, and domain-specific data
  - **Task Memory:** Ongoing tasks, goals, and progress tracking
  
- **Memory Operations:**
  - Create, read, update, and delete memory entries
  - Search and query capabilities across memory content
  - Automatic categorization and tagging of memory entries
  - Memory expiration and archival policies
  
- **Security and Privacy:**
  - End-to-end encryption for sensitive memory data
  - User consent management for memory collection and usage
  - GDPR/privacy compliance for memory data handling
  - Audit trails for memory access and modifications
  
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Efficient retrieval mechanisms with sub-second response times
  - Caching strategies for frequently accessed memory
  - Pagination and lazy-loading for large memory datasets
  - Memory compression and optimization algorithms

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agents can store and retrieve user-specific information that persists across sessions
- Multiple agents can simultaneously access and modify shared memory without data corruption
- Memory data is properly categorized and searchable by agents
- User privacy is maintained with proper access controls and encryption
- Memory operations complete within acceptable performance thresholds (< 100ms for reads, < 500ms for writes)
- Users can view, modify, and delete their stored memory data through appropriate interfaces
- Memory system maintains high availability (99.9% uptime) and data consistency
- Integration with existing agent framework requires minimal code changes
- Memory usage is optimized to prevent unbounded growth and storage costs

## 2. Memory-Aware Agent Orchestration
**Objective:**  
Enhance agent coordination and task handoffs by leveraging shared memory for context-aware decision making and seamless workflow continuity.

**Key Requirements:**
- **Context Handoff Management:**
  - Agents can pass detailed context to successor agents through shared memory
  - Automatic context summarization for long-running conversations
  - Context relevance scoring and prioritization

- **Collaborative Memory Building:**
  - Multiple agents contribute to building comprehensive user profiles
  - Conflict resolution for contradictory information from different agents
  - Memory validation and fact-checking mechanisms

- **Adaptive Behavior:**
  - Agents adapt their responses based on user's historical interactions
  - Learning from past successes and failures stored in memory
  - Dynamic adjustment of agent behavior based on user feedback patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agents demonstrate improved response relevance based on historical context
- Context handoffs between agents maintain conversation continuity
- User satisfaction metrics improve due to personalized agent interactions
- Memory-driven insights enhance agent decision-making accuracy

## 3. Memory Analytics and Insights
**Objective:**  
Provide users and administrators with visibility into memory usage patterns, insights generation, and optimization recommendations.

**Key Requirements:**
- **Memory Usage Dashboard:**
  - Visual representation of memory storage and growth patterns
  - Categorization breakdown of different memory types
  - Storage optimization recommendations

- **Insight Generation:**
  - Automated analysis of user patterns and preferences
  - Trend identification across user interactions
  - Predictive suggestions based on memory analysis

- **Memory Health Monitoring:**
  - Detection of memory inconsistencies or corruption
  - Performance metrics and optimization alerts
  - Data quality scoring and improvement suggestions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can view comprehensive analytics about their memory usage and patterns
- Administrators receive actionable insights for system optimization
- Memory health issues are detected and resolved proactively
- Analytics drive measurable improvements in agent performance and user satisfaction
