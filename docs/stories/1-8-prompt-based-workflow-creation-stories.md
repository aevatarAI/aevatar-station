# Prompt-Based Workflow Creation & Editing

## Overview
Enables users to create sophisticated agent workflows using natural language prompts, with seamless transition to manual editing capabilities for refinement and customization.

### User Story 1: Natural Language Workflow Description

As a user building workflows, I want to describe my desired automation in natural language so that I can quickly create workflows without needing to understand technical workflow design concepts.

  - Clean, intuitive text input area with placeholder text and examples.
  - Support for multi-line descriptions and rich text formatting.
  - Real-time character count and prompt complexity indicators.
  - Auto-save functionality to prevent loss of work.
- **Prompt Templates & Examples:**
  - Pre-built templates for common workflow patterns (data processing, content generation, approval workflows).
  - Interactive examples users can modify and learn from.
  - Contextual suggestions based on user's previous workflows.
- **Prompt Validation:**
  - Real-time feedback on prompt clarity and completeness.
  - Suggestions for improving ambiguous descriptions.
  - Warning indicators for potentially impossible requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I want to create a workflow using natural language  
**When** I access the prompt input interface  
**Then** I can enter workflow descriptions in natural language using an intuitive interface  

**Given** I am new to creating workflow prompts  
**When** I access the prompt creation interface  
**Then** the system provides helpful templates and examples to guide prompt creation  

**Given** I am creating a workflow prompt  
**When** I enter my description  
**Then** real-time validation helps me improve my prompts before generation  

**Given** I am working on a workflow prompt  
**When** I make changes or pause my work  
**Then** prompts are automatically saved to prevent data loss  

**Given** I submit a workflow prompt  
**When** the system evaluates my prompt  
**Then** I receive immediate feedback on prompt quality and feasibility

### User Story 2: AI-Powered Workflow Generation

As a user, I want the system to automatically generate a visual workflow from my natural language description so that I can see my automation come to life without manual design work.

### Key Features
- **AI Prompt Interpretation:**
  - Advanced NLP engine that understands workflow intent, sequence, and dependencies.
  - Recognition of agent types, triggers, actions, and data flow requirements.
  - Support for complex patterns including parallel execution, conditional logic, and loops.
  - Context-aware interpretation based on available system capabilities.
- **Visual Workflow Generation:**
  - Automatic creation of drag-and-drop compatible workflow diagrams.
  - Intelligent node placement with clean, readable layouts.
  - Proper connection routing between nodes with clear data flow visualization.
  - Automatic assignment of appropriate node types based on described functionality.
- **Configuration Mapping:**
  - Automatic parameter configuration based on prompt context.
  - Generation of meaningful node names and descriptions.
  - Intelligent default settings for common use cases.
  - Preservation of user-specified requirements and constraints.

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I provide a natural language workflow description  
**When** the AI processes my prompt  
**Then** the system accurately interprets workflow intent from my description  

**Given** my workflow description is processed by the AI  
**When** the workflow is generated  
**Then** generated workflows include all necessary nodes (Agent, Event, Output, Connector) properly connected  

**Given** I describe complex workflow patterns  
**When** the AI generates the workflow  
**Then** complex workflow patterns (parallel, conditional, loops) are correctly represented  

**Given** the AI generates a workflow  
**When** I examine the generated workflow  
**Then** generated workflows comply with system rules (e.g., Tools only connect to Agent Nodes)  

**Given** the AI creates workflow nodes  
**When** I view the generated workflow  
**Then** all generated nodes have meaningful names, descriptions, and appropriate default configurations  

**Given** I submit a typical workflow prompt  
**When** the generation process runs  
**Then** workflow generation completes within 10 seconds for typical prompts  

**Given** the AI generates a workflow  
**When** I attempt to run it  
**Then** generated workflows are immediately executable without manual intervention

### User Story 3: Seamless Manual Editing Transition

As a user, I want to seamlessly transition from AI-generated workflows to manual editing so that I can refine and customize the workflow to my exact needs.

### Key Features
- **One-Click Editing Mode:**
  - Instant transition from generated workflow to drag-and-drop editor.
  - Full preservation of all generated configurations and settings.
  - Maintenance of workflow history and generation metadata.
- **Editor Integration:**
  - Complete compatibility with existing visual workflow designer.
  - All editing capabilities available (add, remove, modify nodes and connections).
  - Undo/redo functionality that includes prompt generation steps.
  - Ability to regenerate specific workflow sections from refined prompts.
- **Hybrid Editing:**
  - Option to re-prompt for specific workflow sections while preserving manual edits.
  - Clear visual indicators showing which parts were AI-generated vs. manually edited.
  - Ability to save and reuse successful prompt patterns for future workflows.

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have an AI-generated workflow  
**When** I choose to edit it manually  
**Then** I can instantly switch from generated workflow to manual editing mode  

**Given** I transition from generated workflow to manual editing  
**When** the transition occurs  
**Then** all generated configurations and settings are preserved during transition  

**Given** I am in manual editing mode after generation  
**When** I access editing features  
**Then** the full drag-and-drop editor functionality is available for workflow refinement  

**Given** I want to improve specific parts of my workflow  
**When** I use refined prompts  
**Then** I can regenerate specific portions of workflows using refined prompts  

**Given** I am working with generated and manual edits  
**When** I use undo/redo functionality  
**Then** undo/redo functionality includes both AI generation and manual editing steps  

**Given** I have mixed AI-generated and manually edited components  
**When** I view my workflow  
**Then** clear visual indicators distinguish between AI-generated and manually edited components  

**Given** I create successful workflow prompts  
**When** I want to reuse them  
**Then** I can save and reuse successful prompt patterns for future use

### User Story 4: Error Handling & Fallback Options

As a user, I want clear guidance when workflow generation fails so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:**
  - Clear, actionable error messages for ambiguous or impossible prompts.
  - Specific guidance on what aspects of the prompt need clarification.
  - Suggestions for alternative approaches when requirements cannot be met.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:**
  - Graceful degradation to manual workflow creation when AI generation fails.
  - Partial workflow generation with manual completion options.
  - Template suggestions for similar workflow patterns.

  - System learns from failed generations to improve future performance.
  - User feedback collection for continuous improvement.
  - Analytics on common failure patterns and user pain points.

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** workflow generation fails due to prompt issues

**Then** I receive clear, actionable error messages when generation fails  

**Given** my prompt is ambiguous or unclear  
**When** the system identifies issues  
**Then** the system provides specific guidance on improving ambiguous prompts  

**Given** automated generation is not possible for my requirements  
**When** generation fails  
**Then** fallback options are available when automated generation is not possible  

**Given** generation partially succeeds

**Then** I can complete partially generated workflows manually  

**Given** generation failures occur  
**When** the system processes these failures
