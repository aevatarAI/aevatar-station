---

# 1. Dashboard View of Workflow Executions

## User Story
As a user, I want to view all workflow executions (running, completed, failed) in a dashboard so that I can monitor their status in real time.

**Estimated Time:** 16 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can see a list of all workflow executions with their current status (running, completed, failed).
2. Status updates in real time as executions progress.
3. Errors and progress are clearly displayed.

# 2. Per-Node Execution Status

## User Story
As a user, I want to see the execution status of each node within a workflow (pending, running, succeeded, failed) so that I can identify bottlenecks or failures.

**Estimated Time:** 18 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can expand a workflow execution to see the status of each node in the visual workflow designer.
2. Node statuses are updated in real time.
3. Failed nodes are visually distinguished from succeeded or running nodes.

# 3. Filtering and Search Capabilities

## User Story
As a user, I want to filter and search workflow executions so that I can quickly find relevant executions or errors.

**Estimated Time:** 12 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can filter executions by status (running, completed, failed) and time range.
2. Users can search executions by workflow name or ID.
3. Filtered and searched results update the dashboard view accordingly.

# 4. Integration with Designer Play Button

## User Story
As a user, I want executions triggered from the workflow designer's Play button to appear immediately in the execution dashboard so that I can monitor their progress in real time.

**Estimated Time:** 10 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Executions started from the designer are instantly listed in the dashboard view.
2. Status and progress of these executions update in real time.
3. Any errors or completion states are clearly displayed for executions triggered from the designer.
