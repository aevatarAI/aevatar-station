## Technical Architecture

### Debug Pod Infrastructure
- Kubernetes-based pod orchestration
- Container isolation and resource limits
- Automatic scaling and cleanup
- User-specific networking and storage
- Security boundaries and authentication

### Real-Time Communication
- WebSocket connections for bidirectional communication
- Server-Sent Events for streaming updates
- Connection pooling and multiplexing
- Automatic reconnection and state recovery
- Message queuing and buffering

### Data Streaming
- Agent instrumentation framework
- Event-driven architecture for data capture
- Structured logging and tracing
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Data serialization and compression

## Performance Requirements

### Responsiveness
- Debug mode activation: < 5 seconds
- Data streaming latency: < 100ms
- UI updates: < 50ms
- Timeline visualization: 60fps smooth rendering

### Scalability
- Support for 100+ concurrent debug sessions
- Handle workflows with 50+ agent nodes
- Process 1000+ events per second per session
- Maintain performance with large datasets

### Resource Management
- Automatic pod cleanup after 4 hours of inactivity
- Memory limits: 2GB per debug pod
- CPU limits: 2 cores per debug pod
- Storage limits: 10GB per debug session

## Acceptance Criteria Summary
- ✅ User-specific debug pod infrastructure
- ✅ Real-time data streaming from all agents
- ✅ Interactive workflow execution in debug environment
- ✅ Live timeline visualization with execution progress
- ✅ Comprehensive debug data inspection capabilities
- ✅ Authentication-based access control
- ✅ Isolation from production workflows
- ✅ Performance optimization for complex workflows

## Dependencies
- v0.5 Enhanced Execution Progress Tracking
- Kubernetes cluster for pod management
- WebSocket/SSE infrastructure
- Agent instrumentation framework
- Real-time communication layer

## Security Considerations
- User isolation and authentication
- Secure pod-to-pod communication
- Encrypted data transmission
- Audit logging for debug sessions
- Resource quota enforcement

## Breaking Changes
- None - fully backward compatible with v0.5

## Known Limitations
- Debug sessions limited to 4 hours
- Maximum 5 concurrent debug sessions per user
- No collaborative debugging (single-user sessions)
- Limited to workflow-level debugging (no system-level debugging)
