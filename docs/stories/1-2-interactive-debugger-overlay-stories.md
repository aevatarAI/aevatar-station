# 1. Debug Pod Management

## Overview
Provides infrastructure for creating, managing, and reusing user-specific debug pods that serve as isolated execution environments for workflow testing.

### User Story

As an authenticated user, I want the system to automatically create and manage a personal debug pod when I enable debug mode, so that I can have an isolated testing environment that persists across multiple workflow debugging sessions.

**Version:** v1.0

**Time Estimate: 16 hours**

### Key Features
- **Pod Lifecycle Management:**
  - Automatic creation of user-specific debug pods on first debug mode activation
  - Pod persistence and reuse across multiple debugging sessions
  - Clean resource management and pod cleanup when sessions expire
- **Isolation & Security:**
  - Each user gets their own isolated debug environment
  - Debug pods are completely separated from production workflows
  - Secure pod-to-user mapping and authentication
- **Resource Management:**
  - Efficient resource allocation and monitoring
  - Automatic cleanup of inactive debug pods
  - Resource limits and quotas per user

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I am an authenticated user activating debug mode for the first time  
**When** I enable debug mode  
**Then** a user-specific debug pod is automatically created  

**Given** I have an existing debug pod from previous sessions  
**When** I activate debug mode again  
**Then** the same debug pod is reused for my debugging session  

**Given** I am using a debug pod  
**When** other users are also debugging  
**Then** my debug pod is completely isolated from production environments and other users' pods  

**Given** my debug pod has been inactive for a configurable period  
**When** the cleanup process runs  
**Then** the debug pod is automatically cleaned up to free resources  

**Given** I am using debug resources  
**When** the system monitors resource usage  
**Then** my usage is limited according to defined quotas per user  

**Given** debug pod creation fails  
**When** I attempt to enable debug mode  
**Then** I receive clear error messages explaining the failure  

**Given** I am not authenticated  
**When** I attempt to access debug functionality  
**Then** debug pods cannot be created and access is properly restricted

# 2. Real-Time Data Streaming Infrastructure

## Overview
Establishes the technical infrastructure for streaming real-time data from workflow agents to the debugging interface using WebSocket or Server-Sent Events connections.

### User Story

As a workflow debugger, I want all agents in my workflow to stream their execution data (inputs, outputs, and states) in real-time to the debug interface, so that I can observe what's happening during workflow execution as it occurs.

**Time Estimate: 20 hours**

### Key Features
- **Agent Instrumentation:**
  - All workflow agents are instrumented with debugging hooks
  - Capture and stream inputs, outputs, and states
  - Error and exception streaming with stack traces
- **Connection Management:**
  - WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections for real-time data delivery
  - Connection resilience with automatic reconnection
  - Efficient data serialization and compression
- **Data Streaming:**
  - Real-time streaming of agent execution data
  - Structured data format for consistent parsing

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have workflows running in debug mode  
**When** agents execute  
**Then** all agents automatically stream execution data in real-time  

**Given** agents are executing in debug mode  
**When** they process data  
**Then** streaming includes inputs, outputs, states, and errors  

**Given** I enable debug mode  
**When** the debug session starts  
**Then** a WebSocket/SSE connection is established for real-time data delivery  

**Given** my WebSocket/SSE connection is temporarily lost  
**When** network connectivity is restored  
**Then** the connection automatically reconnects without data loss  

**Given** agents are streaming execution data  
**When** I receive the data in the debug interface  
**Then** the data is properly formatted and structured for UI consumption

# 3. Interactive Workflow Execution

## Overview
Enables users to execute workflows directly from the debug interface with real-time progress tracking and execution control.

### User Story

As a workflow debugger, I want to execute workflows directly from the debug interface and see live progress updates, so that I can test my workflows in the debug environment and observe their behavior in real-time.

**Version:** v0.5

**Time Estimate: 12 hours**

### Key Features
- **Execution Controls:**
  - Play/execute button within the debug interface
  - Ability to trigger workflow execution in debug pod
  - Stop/cancel execution capability
- **Progress Tracking:**
  - Live progress indicators for each agent in the workflow
  - Real-time status updates (pending, running, completed, failed)
  - Execution timing and performance metrics
- **Integration:**
  - Seamless integration with debug pod infrastructure
  - Coordination with real-time streaming for live updates
  - Proper error handling and user feedback

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I am in the debug interface  
**When** I view the execution controls  
**Then** I can execute workflows directly from the debug interface  

**Given** I trigger a workflow execution  
**When** the workflow starts  
**Then** execution runs in my dedicated debug pod  

**Given** a workflow is executing in debug mode  
**When** agents start, progress, and complete  
**Then** live progress indicators show the current status of each agent  

**Given** I have a running workflow execution  
**When** I need to stop it  
**Then** I can stop/cancel workflow execution and receive immediate feedback  

**Given** a workflow execution completes or fails  
**When** the execution finishes  
**Then** execution results are immediately visible in the debug interface  

**Given** a workflow execution fails  
**When** I view the results  
**Then** clear error messages and failure points are displayed  

**Given** I want to test multiple variations  
**When** I run sequential executions  
**Then** multiple workflow executions can be run in the same debug session  

**Given** I am debugging workflows  
**When** other users are also debugging  
**Then** my execution is isolated from production workflows and other users' debug sessions

# 4. Live Timeline & Execution Visualization

## Overview
Provides visual representation of workflow execution with live updates, showing the flow of execution and current status of each agent in an intuitive timeline format.

### User Story

As a workflow debugger, I want to see a live timeline visualization of my workflow execution that updates in real-time, so that I can understand the execution flow, identify bottlenecks, and see which agents are currently running or have completed.

**Version:** v0.6

**Time Estimate: 16 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have a workflow executing in debug mode  
**When** agents start, progress, and complete  
**Then** the timeline visualization updates in real-time during execution  

**Given** I am viewing the timeline  
**When** agents have different statuses  
**Then** each agent's status (pending, running, completed, failed) is clearly indicated  

**Given** my workflow has sequential and parallel execution paths  
**When** I view the timeline  
**Then** execution sequence and timing are visually represented with clear distinction between sequential and parallel execution  

**Given** agents are currently executing  
**When** I view the timeline  
**Then** currently active agents are prominently highlighted  

**Given** my workflow encounters failures  
**When** I view the timeline  
**Then** failed agents and error propagation are clearly marked  

**Given** a workflow execution completes  
**When** I want to analyze what happened  
**Then** the timeline persists after execution completion for post-execution analysis  

**Given** I have complex workflows with many agents  
**When** I view the timeline  
**Then** the timeline is responsive and performs well regardless of workflow complexity
