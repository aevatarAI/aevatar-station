Epic: 3. Workflow Save/Load Functionality via UI
---

# 1. Workflow Save Functionality

## Overview
Enables users to persist workflow configurations with versioning and receive appropriate UI feedback during save operations.

### User Story
As a workflow designer user, I want to save my current workflow with automatic versioning so that I can preserve my work and create multiple versions of my workflow configurations without losing any data.

**Version:** v0.4

**Time Estimate: 12 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can save the current workflow to the backend, and each save creates a new version.
2. Users receive clear UI feedback (success or failure) when saving workflows.
3. No data loss occurs during save operations, and all workflow data is preserved accurately.
4. The save operation includes proper validation to ensure workflow integrity before persistence.

# 2. Workflow Load Functionality

## Overview
Enables users to retrieve workflow configurations from backend storage, including version selection and template support.

### User Story
As a workflow designer user, I want to load existing workflows from the backend storage and select specific versions so that I can efficiently reuse and recover my saved workflow configurations.

**Version:** v1.0

**Time Estimate: 14 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can load existing workflows from the backend, including selecting specific versions.
2. Users receive clear UI feedback (success or failure) when loading workflows.
3. Users can access and use workflow templates when creating or loading workflows.
4. No data loss occurs during load operations, and workflows are restored exactly as saved.
5. The load operation includes proper validation to ensure loaded workflow data integrity.

# 3. Workflow Download and Import Functionality

## Overview
Enables users to download saved workflows as files and import workflows from external JSON files, providing file-based workflow exchange capabilities.

### User Story
As a workflow designer user, I want to download my saved workflows as JSON files and import workflows from external JSON files so that I can share workflows with others, create backups, and migrate workflows between systems.

**Version:** v1.0

**Time Estimate: 10 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can download any saved workflow as a JSON file to their local system.
2. Users can import workflows from JSON files uploaded through the UI.
3. The downloaded JSON files contain complete workflow data and are human-readable.
4. The import functionality validates JSON file structure and provides clear error messages for invalid files.
5. Users receive clear UI feedback (success or failure) during download and import operations.
6. Imported workflows are accurately reflected in the UI with all nodes, connections, and configurations preserved.
7. The system handles large workflow files efficiently without UI freezing or performance issues.
