# Prompt-Based Workflow Creation & Editing

## Overview
Enables users to create sophisticated agent workflows using natural language prompts, with seamless transition to manual editing capabilities for refinement and customization.

### User Story 1: Natural Language Workflow Description

As a user building workflows, I want to describe my desired automation in natural language so that I can quickly create workflows without needing to understand technical workflow design concepts.

### Key Features
- **Prompt Input Interface:**
  - Clean, intuitive text input area with placeholder text and examples.
  - Support for multi-line descriptions and rich text formatting.
  - Real-time character count and prompt complexity indicators.
  - Auto-save functionality to prevent loss of work.
- **Prompt Templates & Examples:**
  - Pre-built templates for common workflow patterns (data processing, content generation, approval workflows).
  - Interactive examples users can modify and learn from.
  - Contextual suggestions based on user's previous workflows.
- **Prompt Validation:**
  - Real-time feedback on prompt clarity and completeness.
  - Suggestions for improving ambiguous descriptions.
  - Warning indicators for potentially impossible requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can enter workflow descriptions in natural language using an intuitive interface.
2. The system provides helpful templates and examples to guide prompt creation.
3. Real-time validation helps users improve their prompts before generation.
4. Prompts are automatically saved to prevent data loss.
5. Users receive immediate feedback on prompt quality and feasibility.

### User Story 2: AI-Powered Workflow Generation

As a user, I want the system to automatically generate a visual workflow from my natural language description so that I can see my automation come to life without manual design work.

### Key Features
- **AI Prompt Interpretation:**
  - Advanced NLP engine that understands workflow intent, sequence, and dependencies.
  - Recognition of agent types, triggers, actions, and data flow requirements.
  - Support for complex patterns including parallel execution, conditional logic, and loops.
  - Context-aware interpretation based on available system capabilities.
- **Visual Workflow Generation:**
  - Automatic creation of drag-and-drop compatible workflow diagrams.
  - Intelligent node placement with clean, readable layouts.
  - Proper connection routing between nodes with clear data flow visualization.
  - Automatic assignment of appropriate node types based on described functionality.
- **Configuration Mapping:**
  - Automatic parameter configuration based on prompt context.
  - Generation of meaningful node names and descriptions.
  - Intelligent default settings for common use cases.
  - Preservation of user-specified requirements and constraints.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The system accurately interprets workflow intent from natural language descriptions.
2. Generated workflows include all necessary nodes (Agent, Event, Output, Connector) properly connected.
3. Complex workflow patterns (parallel, conditional, loops) are correctly represented.
4. Generated workflows comply with system rules (e.g., Tools only connect to Agent Nodes).
5. All generated nodes have meaningful names, descriptions, and appropriate default configurations.
6. Workflow generation completes within 10 seconds for typical prompts.
7. Generated workflows are immediately executable without manual intervention.

### User Story 3: Seamless Manual Editing Transition

As a user, I want to seamlessly transition from AI-generated workflows to manual editing so that I can refine and customize the workflow to my exact needs.

### Key Features
- **One-Click Editing Mode:**
  - Instant transition from generated workflow to drag-and-drop editor.
  - Full preservation of all generated configurations and settings.
  - Maintenance of workflow history and generation metadata.
- **Editor Integration:**
  - Complete compatibility with existing visual workflow designer.
  - All editing capabilities available (add, remove, modify nodes and connections).
  - Undo/redo functionality that includes prompt generation steps.
  - Ability to regenerate specific workflow sections from refined prompts.
- **Hybrid Editing:**
  - Option to re-prompt for specific workflow sections while preserving manual edits.
  - Clear visual indicators showing which parts were AI-generated vs. manually edited.
  - Ability to save and reuse successful prompt patterns for future workflows.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can instantly switch from generated workflow to manual editing mode.
2. All generated configurations and settings are preserved during transition.
3. The full drag-and-drop editor functionality is available for workflow refinement.
4. Users can regenerate specific portions of workflows using refined prompts.
5. Undo/redo functionality includes both AI generation and manual editing steps.
6. Clear visual indicators distinguish between AI-generated and manually edited components.
7. Users can save and reuse successful prompt patterns for future use.

### User Story 4: Error Handling & Fallback Options

As a user, I want clear guidance when workflow generation fails so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:**
  - Clear, actionable error messages for ambiguous or impossible prompts.
  - Specific guidance on what aspects of the prompt need clarification.
  - Suggestions for alternative approaches when requirements cannot be met.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:**
  - Graceful degradation to manual workflow creation when AI generation fails.
  - Partial workflow generation with manual completion options.
  - Template suggestions for similar workflow patterns.
- **Learning & Improvement:**
  - System learns from failed generations to improve future performance.
  - User feedback collection for continuous improvement.
  - Analytics on common failure patterns and user pain points.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users receive clear, actionable error messages when generation fails.
2. The system provides specific guidance on improving ambiguous prompts.
3. Fallback options are available when automated generation is not possible.
4. Users can complete partially generated workflows manually.
5. The system learns from failures to improve future generation accuracy.
6. Error handling maintains user confidence and workflow creation momentum.
