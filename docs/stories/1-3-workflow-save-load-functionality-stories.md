Epic: 3. Workflow Save/Load Functionality via UI
---

# 1. Workflow Save Functionality

## Overview
Enables users to persist workflow configurations with versioning and receive appropriate UI feedback during save operations.

### User Story
As a workflow designer user, I want to save my current workflow with automatic versioning so that I can preserve my work and create multiple versions of my workflow configurations without losing any data.

**Version:** v0.4

**Time Estimate: 12 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have created or modified a workflow  
**When** I save the workflow to the backend  
**Then** each save creates a new version and all workflow data is preserved accurately  

**Given** I am saving a workflow  
**When** the save operation completes  
**Then** I receive clear UI feedback indicating success or failure  

**Given** I am saving my workflow  
**When** the save operation is processing  
**Then** no data loss occurs during save operations  

**Given** I attempt to save a workflow  
**When** the system validates the workflow  
**Then** proper validation ensures workflow integrity before persistence

# 2. Workflow Load Functionality

## Overview
Enables users to retrieve workflow configurations from backend storage, including version selection and template support.

### User Story
As a workflow designer user, I want to load existing workflows from the backend storage and select specific versions so that I can efficiently reuse and recover my saved workflow configurations.

**Version:** v1.0

**Time Estimate: 14 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have existing workflows in the backend  
**When** I load workflows from the backend  
**Then** I can access existing workflows and select specific versions  

**Given** I am loading a workflow  
**When** the load operation completes  
**Then** I receive clear UI feedback indicating success or failure  

**Given** I want to create new workflows from templates  
**When** I access the load functionality  
**Then** I can access and use workflow templates when creating or loading workflows  

**Given** I am loading a saved workflow  
**When** the load operation completes  
**Then** no data loss occurs and workflows are restored exactly as saved  

**Given** I load a workflow from the backend  
**When** the system processes the loaded data  
**Then** proper validation ensures loaded workflow data integrity

# 3. Workflow Download and Import Functionality

## Overview
Enables users to download saved workflows as files and import workflows from external JSON files, providing file-based workflow exchange capabilities.

### User Story
As a workflow designer user, I want to download my saved workflows as JSON files and import workflows from external JSON files so that I can share workflows with others, create backups, and migrate workflows between systems.

**Version:** v1.0

**Time Estimate: 10 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have saved workflows in the system  
**When** I choose to download any saved workflow  
**Then** the workflow is downloaded as a JSON file to my local system  

**Given** I have JSON workflow files  
**When** I upload them through the UI  
**Then** I can import workflows from JSON files  

**Given** I download a workflow as JSON  
**When** I examine the downloaded file  
**Then** the JSON file contains complete workflow data and is human-readable  

**Given** I import a JSON workflow file  
**When** the system processes the file  
**Then** the import functionality validates JSON file structure and provides clear error messages for invalid files  

**Given** I am downloading or importing workflows  
**When** the operations complete  
**Then** I receive clear UI feedback indicating success or failure for both operations  

**Given** I import a workflow from JSON  
**When** the import is successful  
**Then** the imported workflow is accurately reflected in the UI with all nodes, connections, and configurations preserved  

**Given** I work with large workflow files  
**When** I download or import them  
**Then** the system handles large workflow files efficiently without UI freezing or performance issues.
