# 1. Canvas-Based Workflow Assembly

## User Story
As a user, I want to assemble workflows by dragging and dropping agent nodes onto a canvas, so that I can visually construct and modify agent workflows.

**Estimated Time: 24 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have access to the workflow designer  
**When** I drag agent nodes from the palette to the canvas  
**Then** the agent nodes are successfully added to the canvas  

**Given** I have agent nodes on the canvas  
**When** I move, modify, or remove agent nodes  
**Then** the changes are reflected in the workflow data model  

**Given** I am working on the canvas  
**When** I use zoom, pan, or undo/redo actions  
**Then** the canvas responds appropriately and maintains workflow integrity  

**Given** I make changes to agent node positions  
**When** the workflow data model is updated  
**Then** all changes are accurately preserved without data loss

# 2. Node Palette with Search and Filter

## User Story
As a user, I want a searchable and filterable palette of agent nodes with descriptive tooltips, so that I can easily find and add the right agents to my workflow based on their name, description, or functionality.

**Estimated Time: 16 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I access the node palette  
**When** I view the available agent nodes  
**Then** all nodes are displayed with consistent visual styling  

**Given** I want to find specific agent nodes  
**When** I search or filter by functionality, name, or description  
**Then** the results show only matching agent nodes with highlighted text  

**Given** I hover over any agent node in the palette  
**When** the tooltip appears  
**Then** I can see the agent's description and functionality details  

**Given** I attempt to add nodes to the canvas  
**When** I select valid agent nodes  
**Then** only valid nodes can be successfully added  

**Given** I browse the palette  
**When** I view the agent nodes  
**Then** nodes are clearly categorized by their primary function or type

# 3. Agent Connection Logic and Execution Flow

## User Story
As a user, I want to connect agent nodes to define execution logic, including sequential, parallel, and conditional flows, so that I can model complex agent workflows.

**Estimated Time: 20 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have multiple agent nodes on the canvas  
**When** I create connections between them  
**Then** the connections define the execution order correctly  

**Given** I need to model complex workflows  
**When** I create sequential, parallel, or conditional connections  
**Then** all connection types are supported and function correctly  

**Given** I have existing connections between agents  
**When** I modify or remove connections  
**Then** the changes are applied successfully to the workflow  

**Given** I attempt to create invalid connections  
**When** the system detects cycles or dead ends  
**Then** the invalid connections are prevented and I receive clear feedback

# 4. Workflow Validation and Error Highlighting

## User Story
As a user, I want the system to instantly validate my workflow and visually highlight invalid configurations, so that I can quickly identify and fix errors.

**Estimated Time: 14 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have unconnected or misconfigured agent nodes  
**When** the system performs validation  
**Then** these issues are detected and visually highlighted  

**Given** I create invalid connections between agents  
**When** the validation runs  
**Then** the invalid connections are visually indicated and blocked  

**Given** I encounter validation errors  
**When** I hover over or select the highlighted issues  
**Then** error messages or tooltips explain the nature of each issue  

**Given** I am editing my workflow  
**When** I make changes to nodes or connections  
**Then** validation occurs in real time as I edit

# 5. Real-Time Data Model Synchronization

## User Story
As a user, I want all modifications in the visual designer to be accurately and instantly reflected in the underlying workflow data model, so that my changes are always saved and consistent.

**Estimated Time: 12 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I make changes to nodes or connections in the visual designer  
**When** the changes are applied  
**Then** the workflow data model is updated in real time  

**Given** I have an active editing session  
**When** I make multiple changes to the workflow  
**Then** the data model remains consistent with the visual state of the canvas  

**Given** I am working on my workflow  
**When** I make any modifications  
**Then** no changes are lost during the editing session

# 6. Desktop Browser Responsiveness and Accessibility

## User Story
As a user, I want the workflow designer interface to be responsive and accessible on desktop browsers, so that I can efficiently use it regardless of my device or accessibility needs.

**Estimated Time: 10 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I access the workflow designer on different desktop screen sizes  
**When** I use the interface  
**Then** it adapts to different resolutions and remains fully functional  

**Given** I have accessibility needs  
**When** I use keyboard navigation or screen readers  
**Then** all controls and features are accessible and usable  

**Given** I interact with the workflow designer  
**When** I use any visual indicators or controls  
**Then** they are clear and usable for all users regardless of accessibility needs

# 7. Workflow Execution Trigger (Play Button)

## User Story
As a user, I want a prominent 'Play' button in the workflow designer so that I can trigger the execution of the currently loaded workflow directly from the UI.

**Estimated Time: 10 hours**

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I am in the workflow designer  
**When** I view the interface  
**Then** a prominent 'Play' button is visible and accessible  

**Given** my workflow has critical errors or validation issues  
**When** I view the 'Play' button  
**Then** the button is disabled and I cannot trigger execution  

**Given** my workflow passes validation with no critical errors  
**When** I click the 'Play' button  
**Then** the workflow execution is triggered successfully  

**Given** I trigger a workflow execution  
**When** the execution starts  
**Then** I receive clear feedback through loading indicators or status messages  

**Given** I trigger an execution from the designer  
**When** the workflow starts running  
**Then** the execution appears in the execution dashboard in real time
