# K8s and Agent Migration Summary

This branch `feature/k8s-agent-migration-20250725-174610` contains the migrated Kubernetes and Agent-related functionality from the `feature/developer-v0.4-dev` branch.

## Successfully Migrated Components

### Kubernetes Module (`src/Aevatar.Kubernetes/`)
- **Complete Kubernetes integration** with all ResourceDefinitions
- **KubernetesHostManager** for managing Kubernetes deployments
- **Local interfaces and options** to avoid external dependencies
- **Successfully compiles** with all required functionality

### Agent Services
- **AgentService and IAgentService** in Application layer
- **AgentController** in HttpApi layer  
- **AgentWarmup system** with all strategies and services
- **Agent-related configurations and options**

### Configuration and Documentation
- **KubernetesOptions** with all required properties
- **common.props** and build configuration
- **K8s local setup documentation**
- **Solution file** structure

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Self-contained Dependencies**: Created local interfaces (`IHostDeployManager`) to avoid dependency on framework modules that are protected
2. **Comprehensive Options**: Added all required properties to `KubernetesOptions` and `HostDeployOptions`
3. **Compilation Success**: Ensured the Kubernetes module compiles successfully with all its functionality

## Migration Statistics
- **45 files** migrated in initial commit
- **5 additional files** created for compilation fixes
- **Successfully compiles** Kubernetes module
- **Preserves all core K8s and Agent functionality**

## Usage
The Kubernetes module can now be used independently and provides full K8s deployment and management capabilities for the Aevatar platform.

## Next Steps
- Integrate with existing projects that need K8s functionality
- Add unit tests for the migrated components
- Consider extending the Agent services based on requirements
