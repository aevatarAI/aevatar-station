# AI Agent Workflow Engine â€“ Product Specifications

## 1. Visual Workflow Designer (Drag-and-Drop Interface)
**Version**
v0.4

**Objective:**  
Empower users to intuitively build, modify, and comprehend agent workflows through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface.

**Key Requirements:**
- Canvas-based, node-centric environment for assembling workflows.
- A palette featuring agent actions, triggers, and connectors.
- Ability to link nodes to establish execution logic, including sequential, parallel, and conditional flows.
- Features for zooming, panning, and undoing/redoing actions.
- Instant validation of workflow integrity (e.g., detection of unconnected nodes).
- Optimized for desktop browser responsiveness.
- The designer must enable users to choose from available Agent Nodes when constructing workflows:
  - **Agent Node:** AI agents such as Summarizer, Retriever, Planner, and other custom agents
- Agent nodes should have a consistent visual style in the palette.
- The interface should allow users to filter or search agent types by their functionality or name.
- **Play Button:**
  - A prominent "Play" button is available in the designer UI, allowing users to trigger the execution of the currently loaded workflow.
  - The button is only enabled when the workflow passes validation (no critical errors).
  - UI feedback is provided when execution starts (e.g., loading indicator, status message).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can add, modify, and remove nodes and their connections.
- The system visually highlights invalid workflow configurations.
- All modifications are accurately represented in the underlying workflow data model.
- Users can trigger workflow execution by clicking the "Play" button in the designer.
- The "Play" button is disabled if the workflow is invalid or incomplete.
- UI provides clear feedback when execution is triggered (e.g., status, errors, or success).

## 2. Interactive Debugger Overlay (Real-Time Workflow Testing)
**Version**
v0.6

**Objective:**
Allow users to test and debug workflows in real-time through an interactive debugging environment with live data streaming capabilities.

**Key Requirements:**
- Debug mode toggle in the workflow designer.
- **Debug Pod Infrastructure:**
  - A dedicated debug pod/container spins up when debug mode is activated.
  - Debug pods are user-specific and can be reused across different workflows by the same user.
  - Users can play/test multiple workflows within the same debug environment without needing to recreate the pod.
  - Isolated execution environment to prevent interference with production workflows.
- **Real-Time Data Streaming:**
  - All agents in the workflow are instrumented with debugging streams.
  - Events and state changes are streamed live to the debugging overlay.
  - Users can observe data flow and transformations as they happen during execution.
- **Interactive Testing:**
  - Users can trigger workflow execution directly from the debug overlay.
  - Real-time progress tracking with live updates of agent states.
  - Ability to see intermediate results and data transformations as they occur.
- Access restricted to authenticated users.
- Clear indication when in debug mode.
- Debug mode shows clearly the timeline of execution with live updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Only authenticated users can access debug overlay.
- A user-specific debug pod automatically spins up when debug mode is first activated and can be reused for subsequent workflow debugging sessions.
- Users can execute multiple different workflows within the same debug environment and see real-time results.
- All agent events and state changes are streamed live to the debugging overlay.
- Users can observe data flow and transformations in real-time during workflow execution.
- Debug environment is isolated from production workflows and other users' debug sessions.
- Execution sequence and progress are shown with live updates.

## 3. Workflow Save/Load Functionality via UI
**Version**
v0.4

**Objective:**
Allow users to persist and retrieve workflow configurations.

**Key Requirements:**
- Save current workflow to backend (with versioning).
- Load existing workflows in the form of JSON file into the designer.
- UI feedback for save/load success or failure.
- Support for workflow templates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can save and load workflows without data loss.

## 4. Execution Progress Tracking Dashboard
**Version**
v0.4, v0.5

**Objective:**
Provide real-time visibility into workflow execution status and progress.

**Key Requirements:**
- Dashboard view showing running, completed, and failed workflows.
- Per-node execution status (pending, running, succeeded, failed).
- Execution logs and error messages.
- Filtering and search capabilities.
- Workflows triggered via the "Play" button in the Visual Workflow Designer are immediately reflected in the dashboard, showing their execution status in real time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can monitor workflow execution in real time.
- Errors and progress are clearly displayed.
- Executions triggered from the designer are visible in the dashboard with up-to-date status.

---

## 5. Workflow Template Library
**Version**
v1.0

**Objective:**
Accelerate user onboarding and workflow creation with pre-built automation blueprints.

**Key Requirements:**
- Library of common workflow templates.
- Template preview and description.
- One-click import into user's workspace.
- Support for community-contributed templates (optional).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can browse, preview, and import templates.
- Imported templates are editable.

---

## 6. Plugin Management Page
**Version**
v1.0

**Objective:**
Enable users to upload, manage, and utilize plugins, making them available as agent nodes within the visual workflow designer.

**Key Requirements:**
- Dedicated page for uploading and managing plugins (e.g., custom AI agents, tools).
- Project-Level Plugin Upload: Plugins can be uploaded at the 'Project' level. Any user within the project will be able to use the uploaded plugin in their workflows.
- List view of all uploaded plugins with metadata (name, version, description, status).
- Ability to upload new plugins and update or remove existing ones.
- Validation and feedback for plugin upload (success, failure, compatibility).
- Plugins that pass validation should automatically appear as selectable agent nodes in the workflow designer palette for all project users.
- Search and filter functionality for plugins.
- Support for plugin versioning and rollback.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can upload, update, and remove plugins via the management page at the project level.
- Successfully uploaded plugins are available as agent nodes in the workflow designer for all users in the project.
- Invalid or incompatible plugins are clearly flagged and not loaded into the designer.
- Users receive clear feedback on plugin management actions.
