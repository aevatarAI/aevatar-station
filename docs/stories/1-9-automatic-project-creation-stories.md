---

# 1. Automatic Default Project Creation

## User Story
As an organization creator, I want a default project to be automatically created when I create a new organization so that I can immediately start building workflows without manual setup.

**Version:** v0.6

**Estimated Time:** 12 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I am creating a new organization  
**When** the organization creation process completes successfully  
**Then** a default project is automatically created with a meaningful name (e.g., "[Organization Name] - Main Project")  

**Given** a default project has been created for my organization  
**When** I check the project configuration  
**Then** the project includes all necessary infrastructure (database entries, permissions, workflow support)  

**Given** the organization creation process encounters an error  
**When** the default project creation fails  
**Then** I receive a clear error message and have the option to retry project creation

# 2. User Navigation to Workflow Dashboard

## User Story
As a new organization owner, I want to be automatically redirected to the workflow dashboard within my default project so that I can immediately begin creating workflows.

**Version:** v0.6

**Estimated Time:** 8 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have just created a new organization with a default project  
**When** the organization setup completes  
**Then** I am automatically redirected to the workflow dashboard within the default project  

**Given** I am redirected to the workflow dashboard  
**When** the dashboard loads  
**Then** I can see clear visual indicators showing I am in my default project  

**Given** the automatic redirection fails  
**When** I try to access the system  
**Then** I receive clear guidance on how to navigate to my default project manually

# 3. Default Project Permissions and Configuration

## User Story
As an organization owner, I want my default project to have appropriate permissions and standard configurations so that I can use all workflow features immediately.

**Version:** v0.6

**Estimated Time:** 10 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** a default project has been created for my organization  
**When** I access the project  
**Then** I have full administrative access to all project features and settings  

**Given** I am working within the default project  
**When** I attempt to use workflow features (agents, templates, plugins)  
**Then** all standard workflow functionality is available and properly configured  

**Given** other users are added to my organization  
**When** they access the default project  
**Then** they receive appropriate permissions based on their organization role

# 4. Error Recovery and Fallback Mechanisms

## User Story
As a user, I want the system to handle project creation failures gracefully so that I can still access the platform and complete my setup even if automatic processes fail.

**Version:** v0.6

**Estimated Time:** 8 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** the automatic project creation process fails  
**When** I try to access the system  
**Then** I receive clear error messages explaining what went wrong and what actions I can take  

**Given** I encounter a project creation error  
**When** I choose to retry the process  
**Then** I can attempt project creation again without losing my organization setup  

**Given** automatic navigation to the dashboard fails  
**When** I access the system  
**Then** I receive clear instructions on how to navigate to my default project manually and can do so successfully
