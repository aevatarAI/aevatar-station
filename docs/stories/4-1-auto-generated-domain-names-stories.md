Epic: 4. Auto-Generated Domain Names for New Projects
---

# 1. Automatic Domain Generation During Project Creation

## User Story
As a user creating a new project, I want the system to automatically generate a unique domain name for my project so that I can start using my project immediately without having to think about domain configuration.

**Version:** v0.7

**Estimated Time:** 16 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I am creating a new project  
**When** I complete the project creation form  
**Then** a unique domain name is automatically generated and assigned to my project  

**Given** a domain name is being generated  
**When** the generation process completes  
**Then** the domain follows the format `{project-slug}-{org-identifier}-{random-suffix}.{base-domain}`  

**Given** my generated domain conflicts with an existing domain  
**When** the system detects the conflict  
**Then** a fallback domain is generated using timestamp and hash suffixes  

# 2. Domain Lifecycle Management

## User Story
As a user, I want proper domain cleanup when I delete my project so that domains are properly managed and freed for future use.

**Version:** v0.7

**Estimated Time:** 12 hours

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I delete a project with a generated domain  
**When** the project deletion completes  
**Then** the associated domain is automatically deactivated and removed from DNS  

**Given** a domain has been freed from a deleted project  
**When** future projects are created  
**Then** the domain namespace is available for reuse according to system policies  

**Given** domain cleanup encounters issues  
**When** the cleanup process runs  
**Then** I receive clear notification of any problems and manual intervention options
